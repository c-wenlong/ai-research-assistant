      "  \"Abstract\": \"Background Wikipedia is the largest free online encyclopedia and the seventh most visited website worldwide, containing >45,000 freely accessible English-language medical articles accessed nearly 1.6 billion times annually. Concerns have been expressed about the balance of content related to biological sex on Wikipedia. Objective This study aims to categorize the top 1000 most-read (most popular) English-language Wikipedia health articles for June 2019 according to the relevance of the article topic to each sex and quality. Methods In the first step, Wikipedia articles were identified using WikiProject Medicine Popular Pages . These were analyzed on 13 factors, including total views, article quality, and total number of references. In the second step, 2 general medical textbooks were used as comparators to assess whether Wikipedia\\u2019s spread of articles was typical compared to the general medical coverage. According to the article\\u2019s content, we proposed criteria with 5 categories: 1=\\u201cexclusively female,\\u201d 2=\\u201cpredominantly female but can also affect male individuals,\\u201d 3=\\u201cnot sex specific or neutral,\\u201d 4=predominantly male but can affect female individuals,\\u201d and 5=\\u201cexclusively male.\\u201d Results Of the 1000 Wikipedia health articles, 933 (93.3%) were not sex specific and 67 (6.7%) were sex specific. There was no statistically significant difference in the number of reads per month between the sex-specific and non\\u2013sex-specific articles ( P =.29). Coverage of female topics was higher (50/1000, 5%) than male topics (17/1000, 1.7%; this difference was also observed for the 2 medical textbooks, in which 90.2% (2330/2584) of content was not sex specific, female topics accounted for 8.1% (209/2584), and male topics for accounted for 1.7% (45/2584; statistically significant difference; Fisher exact test P =.03). Female-category articles were ranked higher on the Wikipedia medical topic importance list (top, high, or mid importance) than male-category articles (borderline statistical significance; Fisher exact test P =.05). Female articles had a higher number of total and unique references; a slightly higher number of page watchers, pictures, and available languages; and lower number of edits than male articles (all were statistically nonsignificant). Conclusions Across several metrics, a sample of popular Wikipedia health-related articles for both sexes had comparable quality. Wikipedia had a lower number of female articles and a higher number of neutral articles relative to the 2 medical textbooks. These differences were small, but statistically significant. Higher exclusively female coverage, compared to exclusively male coverage, in Wikipedia articles was similar to the 2 medical textbooks and can be explained by inclusion of sections on obstetrics and gynecology. This is unlike the imbalance seen among biographies of living people, in which approximately 77.6% pertain to male individuals. Although this study included a small sample of articles, the spread of Wikipedia articles may reflect the readership and the population\\u2019s content consumption at a given time. Further study of a larger sample of Wikipedia articles would be valuable.\",\n",
      "  \"Introduction\": \"Introduction Background Wikipedia is the largest, free, multilingual online encyclopedia. It is the seventh most-visited website worldwide and is available in 329 languages, with 6,829,103 articles in the English language as of May 30, 2024 [ 1 - 3 ]. It is also a source for a new generation of artificial intelligence technologies, such as ChatGPT [ 4 ]. Wikipedia articles can be edited and created by anyone from around the world. Wikipedia includes >45,000 freely accessible English articles related to medical topics, which are accessed nearly 1.8 billion times per year [ 5 ]. The editors of health articles range from physicians, researchers, policy makers, medical students, and anyone else interested in human health (eg, patients) [ 6 , 7 ]. Medical articles include topics about human health, health organizations, and notable people in medicine and health care. On Wikipedia, these articles are ranked according to their importance to the field of medicine, and they are also ranked in order of popularity in terms of number of views (traffic to the page). These articles are also assessed for quality within 6 categories ranging from \\u201cstub\\u201d (an article with limited information, not considered enough as an encyclopedic coverage) to \\u201cstart,\\u201d \\u201cC-class,\\u201d \\u201cB-class,\\u201d \\u201cgood article\\u201d (GA), and \\u201cfeatured article\\u201d (FA; with an in-depth examination and peer review) [ 8 ]. Quality can also be assessed by a language-agnostic quality prediction tool that can predict the quality of the Wikipedia article using a single model based on length, references, images, categories, links, and sections [ 9 ]. Before COVID-19, estimates of English medical monthly page views on Wikipedia were around 200 million, with the early part of the pandemic in March 2020 seeing a rise to 400 million hits [ 10 ]. This number decreased to around 150 million in January 2022 [ 10 ]. Estimates in December 2021 found that Wikipedia was the fourth most-visited website for health content (approximately 260 million page views across all languages), surpassing WebMD (approximately 240 million page views), the Mayo Clinic (approximately 230 million page views), the World Health Organization (approximately 80 million page views), and UpToDate (approximately 50 million page views), but below Healthline , the US National Institutes of Health (approximately 600 million page views), and the United Kingdom National Health Service (approximately 460 million page views) [ 10 ]. Nonetheless, Wikipedia remains among the most widespread resources for accessing health or medical information. Online Health-Seeking Behavior The most preferred way of obtaining health information is seeking it on the web because of fewer barriers to accessing content, affordability, coverage of information, interactivity, privacy, and confidentiality [ 11 , 12 ]. Information seeking is often initiated as a response to uncertainty regarding one\\u2019s health, such as considering treatment options or as preparation for a consultation with a health care provider [ 13 , 14 ]. Among other factors, sex has been shown to play a considerable role in information-seeking behavior in some studies, suggesting that female individuals are more active seekers of general health-related information than male individuals, even across disparities in health literacy [ 15 ]. However, other studies have not confirmed any difference in health information seeking between the sexes (eg, [ 13 ]) and instead argue that this is likely because of sociodemographic factors and individual differences. Health information is often also subject to scrutiny from both health care professionals and laypeople [ 16 ]. Part of health behavior, either by default or as a rule, involves seeking and evaluating the quality and reliability of information presented to us [ 16 ]. Representativeness of Male or Female Wikipedia Content Wikipedia editors have been reported to be predominantly male for medical and health articles [ 7 ], and studies have found similar trends for other topics on Wikipedia in different languages, with about 85% to 90% of editors identifying as male, 10% to 15% as female, and 1% to 2% as transgender, even after a slow increase in female contributors from year to year [ 17 - 21 ], a difference attributed to the enduring gender imbalance in computer-related fields [ 22 ]. This difference in editing numbers among the self-identified sexes is believed to be due to psychosocial factors [ 23 , 24 ]. Some editorial behavior is influenced by Wikipedia culture across the whole encyclopedia and the tensions between different editors (eg, core contributors vs peripheral contributors) [ 25 ]. If this study finds obvious unequal coverage for either sex, it is a possibility that it may partly be explained by the creators of the content [ 26 ]. Disparity in gender representation and participation in technology-related fields, particularly in open-source communities, has been studied since the 1980s [ 22 ]. There is sufficient evidence that gender imbalance carries into content generation via social contexts because of various factors, such as women taking up fewer technology-related jobs and sociocultural factors surrounding women (eg, gender stereotypes, gender expectations, women being averse to conflict, lack of time, other life responsibilities such as raising children, lack of user-friendliness, women steering away from competitive environments, women fearing that their content would be deleted or reverted [\\u201cimpostor syndrome\\u201d], and personal choice) [ 24 , 27 ]. The evidence for sexism on Wikipedia is mixed. One article states, \\u201cWP [Wikipedia] is male dominated. That doesn\\u2019t mean it is sexist\\u201d [ 28 ]. Most Wikipedia editor profiles are anonymous (ie, use a username rather than own identity), and it would be difficult to enact direct sexism; however, some reports showed Wikipedia being hostile to women (eg, female editors being harassed by male colleagues) [ 29 ]. Studies have revealed that Wikipedia is biased in how men and women are characterized in their biographies [ 30 ], including how women\\u2019s biographies suitable for inclusion on Wikipedia are twice as frequently categorized into nonnotable and are more frequently nominated for deletion (25%) than men\\u2019s biographies (17%) [ 31 ]. This is true even after international coverage of the \\u201cDonna Strickland effect\\u201d\\u2014a female Nobel Prize winner in physics in 2018 whose Wikipedia profile was deleted [ 31 ]. This points to multilayered gender discrimination and may carry over into content production [ 32 ]. Considering this, no studies have been performed exclusively on health and medical content related to sex and gender. Despite fewer women than men editing Wikipedia, recent research found a minimal amount of evidence of biological sex bias in terms of content [ 33 , 34 ], and 1 study found evidence of bias against men, with articles on male chief executive officer (CEO) profiles generally having a longer profile life span but less reliable sources, being less edited, and receiving less attention than female profiles [ 35 ]. Notably, for coverage of biographies of living persons, out of 1.7 million biographies on Wikipedia, as of May 5, 2019, a total of 77.6% were of men and 22.7% were of women, pointing to possible inequalities in digital coverage of biographies of people [ 36 ]. Other researchers reported the proportion of female biographies to be at 16% [ 33 ]. Several studies have also looked into the gender distribution gap in the representation of actual social groups [ 37 ]. For example, a study of actively publishing economists on Wikipedia found that women are half as likely to have a biographical entry on the English-language Wikipedia than men [ 38 ]. Halfaker [ 39 ] found that for English-language Wikipedia, the average quality of articles on women scientists was lower than that of male scientists before 2014 but exceeded the average quality after that. A study on women mathematicians found biases toward men [ 40 ], whereas a study including Fortune\\u2019s top 1000 CEO profiles found a bias toward women [ 41 ]. It is important to note that these disparities likely reflect the traditional sex roles that existed in society before the turn of the century. There are recent efforts by Wikipedia to remove this gap (#WikiGap and #ProjectRewrite, particularly by Wikimedia Sweden) and by WikiProject Women in Red to address sex inequality on Wikipedia [ 42 - 44 ]. Despite the still existing gaps in the coverage of biographies of living persons, it is unclear if the same disparity exists within other topic areas of Wikipedia, for example, the medical and health pages or regarding content coverage of female or male health topics [ 45 , 46 ]. Because anyone can benefit from access to medical and health information and because health and medical information is available in hundreds of languages, we decided to investigate this area for clarification. We are not investigating the number of male and female editors or readers but are specifically interested in the coverage of male and female health content on Wikipedia. There is a lack of research about the coverage of sex-based health and medical topics in the English-language Wikipedia. We also wanted to compare the Wikipedia articles to the coverage of the topics in general medical textbooks, which, in this study, will provide our baseline. Access to free, reliable, and up-to-date health information is essential because of the size of global traffic to medical and health pages, including Wikipedia. If we learn that there is an obvious disparity in the coverage of medical and health topics, we may be able to investigate the possible contributing factors. We would also like to identify Wikipedia article types that may require improvement in terms of quality. Objectives Because of Wikipedia\\u2019s significance as a leading global resource for health information, this study aims to explore potential disparities in the coverage of health articles related to biological sex. The objectives of the study are as follows: (1) to analyze Wikipedia\\u2019s top 1000 most-read health articles and determine the coverage of sex-specific and non\\u2013sex-specific topics, and (2) to assess the quality of male versus female health content on English-language Wikipedia, using both Wikipedia\\u2019s classification system and other markers of completeness.\",\n",
      "  \"Methods\": \"Methods Ethical Considerations The data that we extracted from Wikipedia is freely available. It did not include any personally identifiable data or any other forms of data that may cause a breach of any ethical or regulatory rules and regulations. No ethics approval was needed. Design This study used quantitative research methods. We have concentrated on the top 1000 Wikipedia health articles as the most popular Wikipedia pages by traffic. Search Strategy First, we defined what we meant by \\u201cmale\\u201d and \\u201cfemale\\u201d health topics. We focused on the medical, biological, or physical characteristics of the human body and not gender (social perception and individual choice of identity). We defined male articles in which the Wikipedia topic in question included at least 80% of people with male biological sex, female articles in which the Wikipedia topic in question included at least 80% of people with female biological sex, and not sex specific, in which the Wikipedia topic in question could relate in equal proportions to all biological sexes. Therefore, we developed criteria for sex-specific and non\\u2013sex-specific health articles based on the degree to which they may correspond to sex specificity: 1=exclusively female, 2=predominantly female but can affect male individuals, 3=not sex specific or neutral, 4=predominantly male but can also affect female individuals, 5=exclusively male. Second, a list of the 1000 most-read medical articles on Wikipedia for June 2019 was identified using the \\u201cWikiProject Medicine Popular pages\\u201d list, which is a list of the top 1000 pages ordered by the number of views as of July 16, 2019 [ 5 ] . Eligibility Criteria Our research was not guided by any framework, although similar categories have been analyzed in previous Wikipedia literature [ 14 ]. Topics related to female anatomy and childbirth and conditions that affect female individuals were deemed \\u201cexclusively female.\\u201d Articles related to male anatomy were deemed to be \\u201cexclusively male.\\u201d Non\\u2013sex-specific articles included topics such as famous people in medicine (both physicians and patients alike, eg, Louis Pasteur, Florence Nightingale, and Phineas Gage), topics ranging from epidemiology or political events (eg, rape statistics and domestic violence), lifestyles related to health (eg, Mediterranean diet, noise pollution, and surrogacy), medical procedures (eg, Rorschach test, hygiene, and x-ray), medical drugs and chemical compounds (eg, buprenorphine, vitamin E, and cannabis), poisonous plants (eg, Datura), medical literature (eg, PubMed and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ), medical conditions (eg, hernia, gastritis, and polio), medical terminology (eg, VO 2 max, biosafety level, and reflex syncope), medical events , and medical professions (eg, pathology and nursing). Screening Process Our methodology included several steps. After extracting a list of the 1000 most-read medical articles on Wikipedia for June 2019, the authors extracted only sex-specific articles (n=67, 6.7%) and placed them in a spreadsheet ( Multimedia Appendix 1 ). The remaining articles concerned health or medical issues previously mentioned in various neutral categories and were therefore classified as \\u201cnot sex specific.\\u201d The list of medical articles was reviewed manually by 2 authors (JMH and NF) to classify the article as primarily or exclusively related to health care in either sex. Disagreements were resolved via discussion and by searching peer-reviewed medical publications for existing data to resolve unclear cases. Assessment of the Quality of Articles We needed to create a comparator to conclude whether the coverage of medical topics on Wikipedia was typical or deviated from a gold standard for the general medical field. Therefore, in step 2, we followed the same method of classification as in step 1, but we replaced the source with medical textbooks. We chose 2 medical textbooks and evaluated topics in the same way as in step 1. Medical textbooks that are standardly used in medical or medicine studies in the United Kingdom and Canada, where the authors are based, are the Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine [ 47 ] and Toronto Notes: Comprehensive Medical Reference and Review for Medical Council of Canada Qualifying Examination and US Medical License Examination [ 48 ]. The counts for these were kept in the Excel spreadsheet for each separate resource ( Tables 1 and 2 ). Unlike in step 1, we did not assess the quality of medical content in the medical textbooks. Table 1 Breakdown of the results for sex-specific health articles on Wikipedia in terms of article assessment.

Similarly, there are conditions or topics concerning health that primarily affect male individuals but can be found in female individuals too, such as testosterone or inguinal hernia [ 49 ], which make up category 4. Our cutoff point for \\u201cpredominantly\\u201d categories was 80% of cases (eg, inguinal hernia appears in an 8:1 male:female ratio) [ 49 ]. Statistical Analyses To assess statistically significant differences for probability samples, we performed standard nonparametric tests, including the Mann-Whitney test and Fisher exact tests. Mann-Whitney tests were chosen as our outcome variables typically do not follow a normal distribution, and Mann-Whitney tests make few distributional assumptions. Fisher exact tests are preferred for contingency tables as they provide an exact test, especially because smaller sample sizes can lead to low expected cell counts [ 50 ].\",\n",
      "  \"Results\": \"Implications of Our Results for the Real World To answer the question of whether there is a difference between male and female articles on Wikipedia in terms of quality and coverage, we can say there are several differences; however, we must also consider the categorization and the basics of how and when a Wikipedia article is created and why. For example, WikiProject Medicine volunteers who work through a priorities list of missing articles, student initiatives to fill gaps on Wikipedia, individuals who edit Wikipedia with a particular interest in a field, professionals who work in their fields and volunteer on Wikipedia as editors or translators, and others, have determined, based on population\\u2019s needs, that these articles were most important. Wikipedia may, therefore, be a mirror of what is required by the general population worldwide rather than a decision of select groups of people or an inherent view. A study conducted in 2021 also found similar results when examining a selected set of professions in terms of gender distribution. It concluded that Wikidata was no more biased than the real world, with men and women being included in similar percentages [ 56 ]. Our study has shown that Wikipedia spread of health-related and medical content for female and male categories was similar to the 2 widely used medical textbooks, but with some relative underrepresentation of female centric topics. More female individuals than males individuals may be seeking health information online. Although the results of this study may be misinterpreted to be more female centric because, it appears that in our sample, there are simply more conditions that have been classified as predominantly female, such as \\u201clabiaplasty,\\u201d or those exclusively female, such as the \\u201ctriple X syndrome,\\u201d all of which can be due to societal trends or even a rise in medical students who require this information, regardless of their sex. Our sample included conditions such as lung cancer, which accounts for 42% of total deaths in women and 58% of deaths in men in the United States [ 57 , 58 ]. Because of the small difference, this was classified as not sex specific, but on a population level, it is more tilted to male individuals. Therefore, our data must not be viewed in a clear-cut male-female split but contextually. In the United States, there are 21,570 obstetricians and gynecologists (ob-gyns; 85.2% female individuals; 14.8% male individuals) [ 59 ] and 13,780 urologists (69.5% female individuals; 30.5% male individuals) [ 60 ], whereby urology treats both sexes [ 61 ]. However, it is fair to say that (in the United States in this case) every woman will require at least 1 ob-gyn at some point in her life, but the needs for a urologist are more individual. Ob-gyns specialize in a wide spectrum of situations, which include fertility and hormone disorders, which alone are more numerous than those in urology. There are several major implications of our research: (1) this study indicates that there may be a difference but not a large disparity between male and female health articles on English-language Wikipedia; (2) this study could be repeated for Wikipedia in other languages, and a comparative analysis could be performed; (3) health information\\u2013seeking behavior may be the driving force for the topmost viewed 1000 Wikipedia articles; (4) these data should be interpreted contextually and not be viewed as a simplistic female-male split, especially for non\\u2013sex-specific articles in which there may still be disparities in presentation, and understanding the nuances at the population-level data is essential for accurate interpretation; and (5) some health care specializations may be more represented than others on the English-language Wikipedia within the top 1000 most-read health articles, but a wider sample of articles is needed to draw any conclusions.\",\n",
      "  \"Discussion\": \"Discussion Principal Findings In the top 1000 health Wikipedia articles in our selected timeframe , there are almost 3 times as many exclusively female or predominantly female articles as exclusively male or predominantly male health articles. However, many of the articles contain sex ratios such as 4:1 and 5:1 (eg, \\u201chuman papillomavirus\\u201d and \\u201canabolic steroid\\u201d) as they were classified in the predominantly categories. This study uncovered that exclusively female and predominantly female articles rank higher on the priority list on Wikipedia, which could be explained by the inclusion of topics related to childbirth and gynecology. There are many more topics for the female reproductive system than for the male reproductive system. This is just the nature of biology, with the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, maternity, gynecology, and perinatal concerns alone having many more subcategories than those concerning the male reproductive system. Wikipedia health content was similar to the 2 medical textbooks, but there was a statistically significant difference, with the 2 medical textbooks having a higher number of female articles but fewer neutral articles. It is important to note that the 2 medical textbooks do not include the same degree of topics about psychology, people in medicine, or political events related to health. When examining Wikipedia articles by type of article, we recognized that 8% (80/1000) were about political events or people. Our analysis has shown that exclusively female or predominantly female articles in this sample contained more references and more unique references than exclusively male or predominantly male health articles but with no statistically significant difference. Both categories of articles had a comparable number of pictures per article. Slightly more edits, on average, were made to exclusively male and predominantly male articles compared to the female topic categories. Both sets of articles include a single controversial article that attracted a much higher number of edits: \\u201ccircumcision\\u201d and \\u201cabortion.\\u201d These 2 articles also have much higher numbers of page watchers. However, with or without these 2 articles, the number of edits and page watchers was not statistically significantly different. The controversial nature of a topic affects the number of edits to an article, making it an unreliable marker of quality. This cannot be used as a measure against a bias toward either sex but as an indication of the controversy within the subject matter. One of the other important facts is that we did not assess readership, as it would be difficult to assess the sex of the readers, and therefore, we cannot draw any conclusions regarding the sexes of readers of specific health articles. It is possible that readership is equal between the sexes or that it varies depending on different countries, cultures, or times of the year (eg, medical school examinations). Comparison With Prior Work Differences between the coverage and quality of content on Wikipedia are not new, and certainly, there are particular gaps that begin with the fact that only about 16% of Wikipedia contributors are women [ 17 , 18 ]. Wikipedia includes a list of all up-to-date research on the subject of sex, gender, gender gap, and women on Wikimedia projects by individuals or organizations associated with the Wikimedia Foundation and external researchers [ 51 ]. The list on Gender Bias On Wikipedia categorizes types of gender bias into \\u201ccontent,\\u201d \\u201cparticipation,\\u201d and \\u201cconsumption,\\u201d and includes research spanning from 2011 to 2023. This list currently includes 42 research projects for \\u201ccontent,\\u201d 17 items for \\u201cparticipation,\\u201d and 3 items for \\u201cconsumption.\\u201d This study will likely fit under the \\u201ccontent\\u201d gender bias type. Of these 42 studies, only 1 (2%; on measuring what matters in gender diversity) mentions health content on Wikipedia [ 52 ]. This study cautions us on using reader attention as a proxy for the importance of the content, given the consistent gender gap in readership and self-focus bias (eg, men reading more biographies of men compared to women), further recognizing that health articles are not biographies and have clear gender dimensions [ 52 ]. A study in 2020 on metrics for quantifying the gender content gap on Wikipedia has shown that in some instances, such as in health care, gender division is important because it allows Wikipedia to organize efforts to improve the gender gap [ 51 ]. We found that on Wikipedia female and male sex categories were comparable in quality, but not in spread. Female category articles were more numerous and also had a higher (albeit nonstatistically significant) number of references and unique references and a higher number of articles in FA status. Wikipedia also contained less content on female health than the 2 medical textbooks. Our results are somewhat in line with a study conducted in 2015 that compared the mean length of the articles on men and women for English-language Wikipedia, in which articles on women were longer (statistically significant) than those on men [ 30 ]. A study in 2016 also found that articles on female CEOs had more references, which were more diverse [ 41 ]. This contrasts with the findings of Gray [ 36 ] and Konieczny and Klein [ 53 ], who, across 25 different language versions of Wikipedia, found that articles about women were consistently 10% shorter on average than those about men. Although our articles ranked similarly on quality for male-specific and female-specific topics, this does not mean there is no room for improvement. For example, all articles, particularly those in health care and medicine, have the potential to reach FA status by improving on several quality dimensions. However, we should remain mindful that the completeness of content may reflect global social or demographic aspects. Articles on certain topics could be needed more because of sociodemographic reasons and not because of favorability or exclusion of one sex over the other. Our study should also not downplay the fact that there could still be other types of inequalities within the content that we could not assess (eg, language structure). For example, a 2019 study found that women in physics, economics, and philosophy are considerably less likely than men to be recognized on Wikipedia across all levels of achievement [ 54 , 55 ]. Differences have been observed in metadata, language, and network structure when comparing male and female Wikipedia biographies, and these differences have been attributed to gender bias [ 30 ]. We did not assess the representativeness or achievements of either sex or gender, but this could potentially add a dimension to our analysis in the future. Implications of Our Results for the Real World To answer the question of whether there is a difference between male and female articles on Wikipedia in terms of quality and coverage, we can say there are several differences; however, we must also consider the categorization and the basics of how and when a Wikipedia article is created and why. For example, WikiProject Medicine volunteers who work through a priorities list of missing articles, student initiatives to fill gaps on Wikipedia, individuals who edit Wikipedia with a particular interest in a field, professionals who work in their fields and volunteer on Wikipedia as editors or translators, and others, have determined, based on population\\u2019s needs, that these articles were most important. Wikipedia may, therefore, be a mirror of what is required by the general population worldwide rather than a decision of select groups of people or an inherent view. A study conducted in 2021 also found similar results when examining a selected set of professions in terms of gender distribution. It concluded that Wikidata was no more biased than the real world, with men and women being included in similar percentages [ 56 ]. Our study has shown that Wikipedia spread of health-related and medical content for female and male categories was similar to the 2 widely used medical textbooks, but with some relative underrepresentation of female centric topics. More female individuals than males individuals may be seeking health information online. Although the results of this study may be misinterpreted to be more female centric because, it appears that in our sample, there are simply more conditions that have been classified as predominantly female, such as \\u201clabiaplasty,\\u201d or those exclusively female, such as the \\u201ctriple X syndrome,\\u201d all of which can be due to societal trends or even a rise in medical students who require this information, regardless of their sex. Our sample included conditions such as lung cancer, which accounts for 42% of total deaths in women and 58% of deaths in men in the United States [ 57 , 58 ]. Because of the small difference, this was classified as not sex specific, but on a population level, it is more tilted to male individuals. Therefore, our data must not be viewed in a clear-cut male-female split but contextually. In the United States, there are 21,570 obstetricians and gynecologists (ob-gyns; 85.2% female individuals; 14.8% male individuals) [ 59 ] and 13,780 urologists (69.5% female individuals; 30.5% male individuals) [ 60 ], whereby urology treats both sexes [ 61 ]. However, it is fair to say that (in the United States in this case) every woman will require at least 1 ob-gyn at some point in her life, but the needs for a urologist are more individual. Ob-gyns specialize in a wide spectrum of situations, which include fertility and hormone disorders, which alone are more numerous than those in urology. There are several major implications of our research: (1) this study indicates that there may be a difference but not a large disparity between male and female health articles on English-language Wikipedia; (2) this study could be repeated for Wikipedia in other languages, and a comparative analysis could be performed; (3) health information\\u2013seeking behavior may be the driving force for the topmost viewed 1000 Wikipedia articles; (4) these data should be interpreted contextually and not be viewed as a simplistic female-male split, especially for non\\u2013sex-specific articles in which there may still be disparities in presentation, and understanding the nuances at the population-level data is essential for accurate interpretation; and (5) some health care specializations may be more represented than others on the English-language Wikipedia within the top 1000 most-read health articles, but a wider sample of articles is needed to draw any conclusions. Limitations There is no direct prior work on sex coverage within health Wikipedia articles. We only analyzed a subset of the 1000 most-viewed Wikipedia articles about medicine and health in a snapshot rather than all 50,000 medical articles. This limits the power of our results. The number of male-specific articles within these 1000 articles is low, which is an important finding, but also limits what conclusions can be drawn given the sample size. Non-significant results on some comparisons may reflect insufficient power rather than the absence of any differences. Future research could be conducted using data from the most recent month to compare results and with a larger sample of Wikipedia articles. When viewing the top 1000 articles for January 2023, it was clear that several articles included in our sample had changed their status. For example, the status of many articles has changed from start to class C, and several have risen or fallen in importance or number of views, which can be partly explained by the changes in the COVID-19 pandemic and people\\u2019s lifestyles. In addition, our analysis was performed before the COVID-19 pandemic; therefore, it is likely that the coverage of some topics was different from the time after the COVID-19 pandemic. We have used a methodology previously used in other studies involving Wikipedia articles (eg, [ 36 , 48 ]). One study showed that the quality of Wikipedia articles is affected by the editor\\u2019s previous number of edited articles, but not the volume of edits [ 40 ]. We could not assess these metrics, which may be interesting to correlate in future studies. Unlike research conducted in 2017 [ 32 ], we did not assess the articles using supervised machine learning and, therefore, could not consider metrics that may have introduced other types of biases among contributors and the content itself, such as article and author perspectives, author characteristics, and balance of nonneutral edits. These measurements might have uncovered supplementary information, indicating that both an author\\u2019s viewpoints and the article\\u2019s prior perspectives played a role in predicting the stance of the resulting edits, with the caveat that these predictors also influence each other [ 32 ]. We may not be able to answer the question of whether Wikipedia is biased, but more if the society is biased. For example, with some pages such as monarchs, you would find many more male individuals covered than female individuals, but that is because female individuals were not allowed to have power or these positions. This raises the following question: Is Wikipedia merely reflecting societal trends, and is the Wikipedia community adequately covering what is needed? We could also not assess the degree of risk particular medical conditions pose and the need or urgency of the information for these. Therefore, the strength and limitation of this study is that it captures Wikipedia activity at a specific point in time, but the results are fluid and mirror societal needs. Our analysis identified some gaps and room for improvement in Wikipedia health articles. Biographies of living persons may not be a fair representation of issues within the core community of Wikipedians (people who edit or contribute to Wikipedia) prioritizing the creation of articles for one sex over the other. Many biographies of living persons end up within Wikipedia because of undisclosed paid editing. An analysis of now-deleted articles created by a collection of accounts from various paid editing companies found that most of the created articles were about male individuals. This leads to the assumption that male individuals and their representatives are more likely to pay money to try to buy an article on Wikipedia than female individuals and their representatives. Conclusions This was the first study to examine the coverage of medical and health content on Wikipedia related to biological sex. In our sample, there were more female health topics than male health topics in the top 1000 most-read health Wikipedia pages in June 2019, but there are relatively fewer female health topics covered than what is seen in medical textbooks. Despite the higher volume of articles on female health topics, the average quality based on various metrics was similar. It is vital to recognize that the needs of people are individual and that both sexes may require or access any of Wikipedia articles. Future endeavors could include prioritizing content to reach GA and FA status as soon as possible. Future research should strive to identify where there may be sex-based differences in needs for health information and whether behavior around health information seeking on Wikipedia differs among the sexes.\"\n",

      "  \"Abstract\": \"Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) is a novel tick-borne bunyavirus that causes severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS), with a high mortality rate of up to 30%. The envelope glycoproteins of SFTSV, glycoprotein N (Gn) and glycoprotein C (Gc), facilitate the recognition of host receptors and the process of membrane fusion, allowing the virus to enter host cells. We previously reported a monoclonal antibody, mAb 40C10, capable of neutralizing different genotypes of SFTSV and SFTSV-related viruses. However, the specific neutralization mechanism is poorly understood. In this study, we elucidated the high-resolution structure of the SFTSV Gn head domain in complex with mAb 40C10, confirming that the binding epitope in the domain I region of SFTSV Gn, and it represented that a novel binding epitope of SFTSV Gn was identified. Through in-depth structural and sequence analyses, we found that the binding sites of mAb 40C10 are relatively conserved among different genotypes of SFTSV and SFTSV-related Heartland virus and Guertu virus, elucidating the molecular mechanism underlying the broad-spectrum neutralizing activity of mAb 40C10. Furthermore, we humanized of mAb 40C10, which is originally of murine origin, to reduce its immunogenicity. The resulting nine humanized antibodies maintained potent affinity and neutralizing activity. One of the humanized antibodies exhibited neutralizing activity at picomolar IC 50 values and demonstrated effective therapeutic and protective effects in a mouse infection model. These findings provide a novel target for the future development of SFTSV vaccines or drugs and establish a foundation for the research and development of antibody therapeutics for clinical applications.\",\n",
      "  \"Introduction\": \"Introduction Bunyavirales is the largest and most diverse group of RNA viruses, consisting of 14 families and 63 genera, with over 552 members, according to the latest classification by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) [ 1 ]. Bunyaviruses are widely distributed globally and can cause various epidemics that can have significant impacts on animal and human health and agriculture. Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) belongs to the genus Bandavirus in the family Phenuiviridae , order Bunyavirales ( https://ictv.global/taxonomy/taxondetails?taxnode_id=202200166&taxon_name=Bandavirus%20dabieense ). It was first isolated in central China in 2009 and subsequently spread to multiple provinces in East China [ 2 ]. Clinical symptoms of SFTSV infection include fever, diarrhea, vomiting, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia, with an initial high mortality rate of up to 30% [ 3 , 4 ]. The disease caused by this virus was officially named severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS). Apart from China, cases of SFTS have been reported in Asian countries such as South Korea, Japan, and Vietnam, with several outbreaks occurring in Southeast Asia, where the mortality rate ranges from 6% to 27% [ 5 \\u2013 8 ]. The World Health Organization (WHO) prioritized SFTS as a disease of top priority for research [ 9 ]. SFTSV is a typical segmented negative-sense single-stranded RNA virus with a genome consisting of three circular RNA segments: small (S), medium (M), and large (L). These segments primarily encode nucleocapsid protein (NP), membrane precursor protein (GP), and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), respectively. Additionally, GP undergoes processing and modification by cellular proteases to yield two transmembrane glycoproteins, glycoprotein N (Gn) and glycoprotein C (Gc). Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) analysis of the structure of the SFTSV virion revealed that Gn and Gc form heterodimers that assemble into hexameric (hexon) and pentameric (penton) peplomers in a clustered manner on the virus membrane [ 10 , 11 ]. SFTSV is geographically distributed [ 12 ]. Phylogenetic analysis of the whole- genome sequences of SFTSV strains has revealed that they can be divided into Chinese and Japanese lineages [ 13 ]. The Chinese lineage predominantly includes C1\\u2013C5 genotypes, while the Japanese lineage encompasses three genotypes, J1\\u2013J3 [ 14 , 15 ]. The genetic diversity of SFTSV is notable, with studies suggesting that the segmented genome of the virus may promote genetic reassortment during virus replication within host cells, giving rise to new viral strains [ 5 , 13 ]. The genetic diversity and complexity of SFTSV present additional challenges for prevention and treatment efforts. SFTSV infection is emerging as a pressing global public health issue, and its incidence is increasing annually. However, there are no vaccines, effective drugs, or specific treatment methods available for SFTSV in clinical practice. Neutralizing antibodies can rapidly and efficiently treat viral infections. Currently, several neutralizing antibodies against SFTSV have been reported in various studies. These include the human antibodies MAb 4\\u20135 [ 16 , 17 ] and Ab10 [ 18 ], as well as the nanobody SNB02 [ 19 ]. All three neutralizing antibodies target the surface glycoprotein Gn of SFTSV. The crystal structure of the SFTSV Gn head\\u2013MAb 4\\u20135 complex has been resolved, elucidating the specific binding epitope and structural features of MAb 4\\u20135, but the neutralizing activity of MAb 4\\u20135 has only been validated in vitro [ 17 ]. Both Ab10 and SNB02 have demonstrated good neutralizing activity and protective effects both in vivo and in vitro [ 18 , 19 ]; however, the specific binding epitopes and structural details of neutralization remain unclear. Therefore, it is essential to screen for broad-spectrum neutralizing antibodies against various genotypes of SFTSV and characterize the resultant antibodies to establish a foundation for subsequent clinical drug development. In our previous study, we employed hybridoma technology to identify the murine monoclonal antibody 40C10 (mAb 40C10), which has strong neutralizing activity against multiple genotypes of SFTSV. In vivo experiments demonstrated the excellent delayed protection ability of the antibody [ 20 ]. Neutralizing antibodies can be acquired not only from diseased or recovered individuals but also through screening of mice immunized with virus particles or pathogenic proteins. Due to the disparity in the humoral immune response between mice and humans, it is possible for novel epitopes distinct from those originating in humans to emerge. However, the application of murine monoclonal antibodies in human clinical settings may lead to the recognition of foreign substances by the human body, resulting in a human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA) immune response [ 21 ]. In addition, murine monoclonal antibodies are unable to effectively trigger complement and Fc receptor effector functions, limiting their clinical application [ 22 ]. Therefore, the humanization of murine monoclonal antibodies is necessary. There are various methods for humanization, such as complementarity-determining region (CDR) grafting and resurfacing [ 23 ]. CDR grafting, involving the replacement of the mouse framework region (FR) with a human FR while preserving the mouse CDR and FR residues that may affect the activity of the mouse CDR, is commonly used and effective [ 24 , 25 ]. Key residues can be determined through the structure of antigen-antibody complexes. A previous study has reported that humanized Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)-neutralizing antibody produced based on structural analysis have efficacy comparable to that of murine antibody [ 26 ]. Recently, after humanization, several murine monoclonal antibodies, such as Olokizumab, which targets Interleukin-6 (IL-6), Efalizumab, which targets lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1), and Palivizumab, which targets the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) F protein, have been marketed and utilized in clinical therapy [ 27 , 28 ]. This demonstrates the successful clinical application of humanized antibodies. In this study, we determined the crystal structure of the SFTSV Gn head domain in complex with the fragment antigen-binding (Fab) portion of mAb 40C10 at a resolution of 2.4 A\\u030a. Based on the structure of the complex, we identified the binding epitope of mAb 40C10 on domain I of SFTSV Gn. We also found that this binding epitope is relatively conserved across various genotypes of SFTSV. This structural analysis provides insights into the broad-spectrum neutralization mechanism of mAb 40C10 and is the first to reveal a novel, potent, and broad-spectrum neutralizing epitope on SFTSV Gn. Furthermore, we performed mAb 40C10 humanization using CDR grafting. The humanized antibody was characterized, and the results demonstrated that the humanized antibody retained potent neutralization activity as well as animal protective and therapeutic efficacy in animals. These findings provide a basis for the clinical development of antibody drugs.\",\n",
      "  \"Methods\": \"Materials and methods Ethical statement All animal procedures were performed in strict compliance with the guidelines of Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals [ 44 ]. The animal experiments were approved by the Ethics Committee of Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences under the approval number WIVA33202006. All cell and animal experiments involving viruses were conducted in Biological safety third-level laboratory (BSL-3) and Animal Biological safety third-level laboratory (ABSL-3). Expression and purification of SFTSV Gn head domain The SFTSV Gn head domain (GenBank accession no. QNR55516.1, residues 20\\u2013340) was fused with a C-terminal avi-tag and an eight-histidine purification tag. This construct was subsequently subcloned into the pAcHBM vector, which had been engineered to incorporate an HBM signal sequence at the N-terminus. Transfection and amplification procedures were carried out using Sf9 cells to generate recombinant baculovirus, while the expression of recombinant proteins was achieved in High Five cells. The cell culture supernatant was harvested 72 h after infection, and the recombinant SFTSV Gn head domain was purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography . The affinity column was washed with 100 mL of wash buffer containing 25 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 25 mM imidazole, pH 8.0, and the target protein was eluted with elution buffer (25 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 500 mM imidazole, pH 8.0). The protein was further purified on a Superdex 75 Increase 10/300 GL size-exclusion column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 25 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH 8.0. SDS-PAGE analysis indicated over 98% purity of the final purified recombinant protein. Fractions from the single major peak were pooled and concentrated to 15 mg/mL. Preparation of mAb 40C10 Fab fragment The selected monoclonal cell strain stable producing mAb 40C10 was injected intraperitoneally into mice to produce ascites [ 20 ]. The mAb 40C10 IgG from mouse ascites was purified by Protein A affinity chromatography column (GE, Hitrap Protein A HP). The mAb 40C10 IgG was pooled and incubated with papain at a mass ratio of 35:1 at 37 \\u00b0C for 9 h, and further purified on a Protein A affinity chromatography to collect the Fab fragment. Analytical gel filtration and purification of the SFTSV Gn head domain\\u2013Fab complex MAb 40C10 Fab was mixed with the SFTSV Gn head domain at a molar ratio of 1:1.2 and incubated on ice for 1.5 h. The complex was further purified on a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL size-exclusion column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 25 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH 8.0, and fractions from the single major peak were pooled and concentrated to 6 mg/mL for crystallization. Crystallization The protein complex was used for crystal screening by vapor-diffusion sitting-drop method, and crystallization screening was performed at 16 \\u00b0C, including PEG/Ion, Crystal Screen, Index, SaltRX from Hampton Research, and Wizard I-IV from Emerald Biosystems. The flake-like crystals appeared after one week in the reservoir solution containing 0.04 M Citric acid, 0.06 M BIS-TRIS propane/pH 6.4, 20% w/v Polyethylene glycol 3,350. The crystals were frozen in liquid nitrogen in reservoir solution supplemented with 25% glycerol (vol/vol) as a cryoprotectant. Structure determination and refinement Diffraction data was collected at the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility BL10U2 (wavelength, 0.97918 A\\u030a) at 100 K. All data sets were processed using DIALS [ 45 ]. The structure was determined by molecular replacement using PHASER [ 46 ] with the SFTSV Gn structure (PDB ID: 5Y11) [ 17 ] and the structures of the Fab fragment available in the PDB with the highest sequence identities. The molecular model was reconstructed with COOT [ 47 ]. Subsequently, structural refinement was performed in Phenix [ 48 ]. In the final stage of model construction and refinement, glycans and waters were added according to the density map. Data collection and detailed statistics were summarized in S1 Table . Images were made by Pymol ( www.pymol.org ) and UCSF ChimeraX [ 49 ]. Point mutations at sites of key residues Based on the three-dimensional structure of the complex, the potential critical binding site of SFTSV Gn was identified, which mediates the interaction between SFTSV Gn and the neutralizing antibody mAb 40C10. Primers were designed to replace the corresponding codons with the GCC sequence, and single amino acid mutation to alanine was introduced using PCR method. The accuracy of point mutation was verified by sequencing, and finally the SFTSV Gn single-point mutant protein was expressed through the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus system. The expression and purification strategy for the SFTSV Gn single-point mutant protein mirrored that of the wild-type SFTSV Gn head domain protein. Humanization of antibody Humanization of antibody was performed using CDR grafting method. The human variable regions that were the most homologous to mouse variable regions as the templates for CDR grafting of mAb 40C10 were identified and selected through NCBI IgG BLAST. Subsequently, critical residues in the FR of templates that could potentially impact the structure of CDRs were reverted to mutations. Ultimately, the designed heavy and light chains were assessed for their degree of humanization using the \\\\\\\"Hu-mAb\\\\\\\" website ( https://opig.stats.ox.ac.uk/webapps/sabdab-sabpred/sabpred/humab ). Finally, humanized antibodies in the form of human IgG1 were cloned into pCDNA3.1 vector, and a large number of plasmids were extracted. The plasmid was transfected with HEK 293F cells with PEI (Sigma, #408727), incubated at 37 \\u00b0C, 5% CO 2 for 5 days, and the supernatant was collected. Humanized antibodies were purified by Protein A affinity chromatography, and purity was determined by SDS-PAGE. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assay The binding kinetics and affinity between mAb 40C10 and SFTSV Gn single-point mutants were measured by SPR (Biacore T200, Cytia). The SPR experiment was conducted in HBS-P buffer (0.01 M Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.05% Surfactant P20), using Protein A chip (Cytia, #29127556) to immobilize mAb 40C10 at a flow rate of 10 \\u03bcl/min. Various concentrations of purified SFTSV Gn single-point mutants, ranging from 400 nM to 1.5625 nM with a 1:2 dilution factor, were then injected at a flow rate of 30 \\u03bcl/min. The resulting data was analyzed using Biacore Insight Evaluation Software 3.2.1 and fitted to a 1:1 binding model. The binding kinetics and affinity between SFTSV Gn head domain and humanized antibodies were analyzed by SPR. In SPR analysis, an NTA sensor chip (Cytia, #28994951) was utilized to capture the SFTSV Gn head domain with His tags. The SPR experiment was conducted in HBS-P buffer at a flow rate of 10 \\u03bcl/min. A series of diluted purified humanized antibodies, with concentrations ranging from 100 nM to 0.78125 nM and a dilution factor of 1:2, were injected. The resulting data were analyzed using Biacore Insight Evaluation Software 3.2.1 and fitted to a 1:1 binding model. Neutralization assay According to previous research [ 20 ], first, the antibodies were serially diluted two times in DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 \\u03bcg/mL streptomycin. Subsequently, the diluted antibodies were mixed and incubated with an equal volume of SFTSV at a dose of 100 TCID 50 at 37 \\u00b0C for 1 h and added to Vero cells (10 5 cells/well) and cultivated in a 96-well plate at 37 \\u00b0C for 3 days. Finally, SFTSV infection was detected utilizing the polyclonal antibodies (pAb) anti-NPs method, with a control mixture comprising virus and PBS. Hoechst 33258 dye (Beyotime, #C1018) was utilized for nuclear staining. Images were captured, and the quantities of SFTSV-infected cells and total cells per well were determined using the Operetta CLSTM high-throughput system (PerkinElmer). The inhibitory effects post serial dilution were analyzed employing GraphPad Prism software version 8.0.2. Animal experiments In the prophylactic treatment group, 6-week-old female IFNAR -/- C57BL/6 mice (n = 9/group) were administered either 30 \\u03bcg/g humanized antibody or mouse antibody via intraperitoneal injection. Following the administration of antibodies after 1 day, the mice were intraperitoneally injected with a 50 LD 50 dose of SFTSV. In the therapeutic treatment group, 6-week-old female IFNAR -/- C57BL/6 mice (n = 9/group) were intraperitoneal injected with SFTSV at a 50 LD 50 dose of SFTSV. At day 1 post-SFTSV injection, the mice were intraperitoneally administered with 30 \\u03bcg/g humanized antibody or mouse antibody. An equal volume of PBS was administered as control. In all groups, body weights and survival rates of mice were monitored and recorded for 12 days after infection. Three mice were sacrificed on the 5th and 12th day after infection, and liver, spleen, lung and kidney were extracted. Tissue sections were prepared, and hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining and immunohistochemical assays was performed as previously described [ 40 ]. qRT\\u2013PCR Tissue and serum samples were subjected to lysis and extraction utilizing the MiniBEST Viral RNA/DNA Extraction Kit Ver.5.0 (TaKaRa, #9766) in accordance with the manufacturer\\u2019s protocol. After RNA extraction, SFTSV RNA load quantification was conducted employing the one-step real-time qRT\\u2013PCR and the HiScript II One Step qRT\\u2013PCR Probe Kit (Vazyme, #Q222-01) on the Applied Biosystems StepOnePlus (ThermoFisher). The priming and probe sequences were F: 5\\u2019-GGGTCCCTGAAGGAGTTGTAAA-3\\u2019, R: 5\\u2019-TGCCTTCACCAAGACTATCAATGT-3\\u2019, HEX-5\\u2019-TTCTGTCTTGCTGGCTCCGC-3\\u2019-BHQ-2. Assessment of mAb 40C10 inhibition effects on the SFTSV infection process Experiments were conducted using a 24-well plate, with 2\\u00d710 5 Vero cells seeded per well. The cells were infected with SFTSV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1. To investigate whether the mAb 40C10 would affect virus attachment to cells, the virus was pre-incubated with either the antibody mAb 40C10 or PBS at 37\\u00b0C for 1 hour. The mixture was then added to the cells, which were incubated at 4\\u00b0C for 1 hour. After incubation, the unbound virus was washed away with cold PBS. The cells were collected and TRIzol (Takara) was added to extract RNA. To further explored whether the mAb 40C10 would affect the virus endocytosis based on the characteristics of SFTSV invasion of cells [ 39 ]. The initial stage of virus adsorption followed the same steps as above. After washing away the unbound virus with cold PBS, the cells were cultured in a medium containing 20 mM NH 4 Cl at 37\\u00b0C for one hour. NH 4 Cl (20 mM) can inhibit the fusion of the virus with the endosome membrane [ 40 ]. The cells were then washed three times with PBS containing 500 \\u03bcg/mL proteinase K at room temperature to remove the virus that did not enter the cells. The cells were collected and TRIzol (Takara) was added to extract RNA according to the manufacturer\\u2019s instructions. Then the cDNA was obtained by PrimeScript RT reagent Kit with gDNA Eraser (Perfect Real Time, #RR047A) and the qPCR was detected by TB Green Premix Ex Taq II (Tli RNaseH Plus, #RR820A) from Takara. The relative expression of SFTSV NP (primer as previously shows [ 20 ]) and GAPDH (primer: GAPDH-qF: ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC, GAPDH-qR: TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA) was analyzed. All qRT-PCR tests were performed in triplicates for each sample.\",\n",
      "  \"Results\": \"Results Crystal structure of the SFTSV Gn head\\u2013mAb 40C10 complex In the previous research, we screened and isolated the mAb 40C10, which has neutralizing activity at 2 ng/mL, using a hybridoma technique ( Fig 1A ). MAb 40C10 demonstrated the ability to neutralize different genotypes of SFTSV and exhibited a notable delayed protective effect in vivo [ 20 ]. Thus, mAb 40C10 displays a broad-spectrum and potent neutralizing effect. To further investigate the molecular mechanism underlying the neutralizing activity of mAb 40C10, we conducted structural biology studies. 10.1371/journal.ppat.1012550.g001 Fig 1 Structural analysis of the SFTSV Gn head\\u2013mAb 40C10 complex. (A) Schematic diagram showing the experimental design. (B) The overall structure of the SFTSV Gn head\\u2013mAb 40C10 complex. The mAb 40C10 heavy chain and light chain are colored salmon and yellow, respectively. The SFTSV Gn head is colored gray and displayed in surface representation. (C) The binding region of mAb 40C10 on the SFTSV Gn head. The region binding to the heavy chain of mAb 40C10 on the SFTSV Gn head is colored salmon, and the region binding to the light chain of mAb 40C10 on the SFTSV Gn head is colored yellow. The CDR loops of mAb 40C10 are colored as above. (D) The detailed interactions between the SFTSV Gn head and the LCDRs, HCDR3 and LFR2. The residues are shown as sticks and colored limon (LCDRs), yellow (LFR2) and pink (HCDR3). The glycosylation site on the SFTSV Gn head and the sugar molecules are presented in stick form and are colored gray and cyan, respectively. The yellow dashed lines represent hydrogen bonds, and the blue dashed lines represent salt bridges. After identifying the binding target of mAb 40C10 as the SFTSV Gn, we constructed the Gn head region, excluding the signal peptide (20\\u2013340), and expressed it using the baculovirus expression system. Additionally, we purified the mAb 40C10 IgG from mouse ascites, subjected it to enzymatic digestion using papain, and obtained the 40C10 Fab fragment. After incubating the Gn head with 40C10 Fab and purifying the complex, we ultimately obtained the stable Gn head\\u201340C10 Fab complex and determined the crystal structure at 2.4 A\\u030a resolution ( S1 Table ). In contrast to the majority of antigen-antibody interactions, mAb 40C10 primarily relies on the light chain to bind with Gn ( Fig 1B and 1C ), and the buried surface areas (BSAs) of the light and heavy chains are 495.4 A\\u030a 2 and 262.5 A\\u030a 2 , respectively ( S2 Table ). The BSA of mAb 40C10 in contact with Gn is 757.9 A\\u030a 2 , which is greater than that of the reported neutralizing antibody MAb 4\\u20135 (614.8 A\\u030a 2 ). Three light-chain complementarity-determining regions (LCDRs), heavy-chain complementarity-determining region 3 (HCDR3) and light-chain framework region 2 (LFR2) together constitute the interaction network with Gn, which is mainly attributed to hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions ( Fig 1D ). N31, Y50, S52, Y53, G66, Y67, N91, Y92, N93 and Y96 of the light chain, along with Y101, Y103, and R106 of the heavy chain form hydrogen bonds to interact with Gn. R106 of HCDR3 and D32 of LCDR1 form salt bridges with D102 and K111 of Gn, respectively ( S3 Table ). In addition, interactions are facilitated by a tight hydrophobic interaction network involving three LCDRs, HCDR3 and LFR2 with R62, H64, S65, Q66, V108, V109, K110, K113, G114, K147 and C156 of Gn. Notably, R106 of HCDR3 forms hydrogen bonds with glycan molecules at the N-linked glycosylation site N63 of Gn ( Fig 1D ). Analysis of the binding epitope of mAb 40C10 on SFTSV Gn The Gn head region mainly contains a signal peptide and three domains, with domain II adjacent to the stem region. Through structural analysis, we identified that the binding epitope of mAb 40C10 is located on domain I of Gn, in contrast with the two neutralizing antibodies previously reported ( Fig 2A ). The binding epitope of MAb 4\\u20135 is located in domain III of Gn [ 17 ], whereas Ab10 binds within the stem region and domain II adjacent to the stem region of Gn [ 18 ] ( Fig 2A ). Thus, this finding indicates the identification of a novel antigen binding site. Subsequently, we conducted a detailed analysis of residues on the interaction interface between mAb 40C10 and Gn. By measuring the affinity between mAb 40C10 and different Gn single-point mutants, we observed that the Gn mutants H64A, K111A, and K113A exhibited a 3\\u20135-fold decrease in affinity for mAb 40C10 compared that of the wild-type (WT) ( S1 Fig ), indicating the critical role of these residues in maintaining the interaction with mAb 40C10. In particular, the K111A mutant showed the greatest reduction in affinity, possibly due to its interaction with both the heavy and light chains ( Fig 1C and 1D ). SFTSV displays genotype diversity [ 5 ], featuring genotypes spanning C1\\u2013C5 and J1\\u2013J3 for the M segment that encodes the SFTSV Gn protein [ 13 ]. We conducted sequence alignments for strains of various genotypes. Remarkably, the essential residues mediating binding to mAb 40C10 were conserved across the different genotypes ( S2A, S2B and S3 Figs). Additionally, we identified the binding epitope in two newly discovered strains based on their genetic evolutionary relationships, Heartland virus (HRTV) and Guertu virus (GTV) [ 29 , 30 ], and found that the key residues were also relatively conserved in these strains ( S2C Fig ). Furthermore, we consistently detected neutralizing activity of mAb 40C10 against different genotypes of SFTSV in vitro , and demonstrated cross-neutralization against both HRTV and GTV [ 20 ]. The above analysis elucidated the molecular mechanism by which mAb 40C10 exhibits broad-spectrum neutralization against various strains, from a structural perspective. 10.1371/journal.ppat.1012550.g002 Fig 2 Analysis of the binding epitope of mAb 40C10 on the SFTSV Gn head. (A) The binding epitopes of mAb 40C10, MAb 4\\u20135, and Ab10 on the SFTSV Gn head are depicted. The three domains of the SFTSV Gn head are colored pale green, light blue and aquamarine. MAb 40C10 is colored gold, MAb 4\\u20135 is colored red, and the binding sites of Ab10 on the SFTSV Gn head are colored purple. (B and C) MAb 40C10 bound to the surface of the SFTSV virion (5-fold local reconstruction of SFTSV virion, EMD-35178), with penton and hexon highlighted in color. The Gn and Gc of penton are colored in cornflower blue and medium purple, respectively, and the Gn and Gc of hexon are colored medium spring green and light pink, respectively. (D and E) MAb 40C10 and MAb 4\\u20135 bind to either the hexon or penton Gn protein. Penton, hexon, mAb 40C10 and MAb 4\\u20135 are colored as above (PDB: 8I4T, 7X6W, and 7X72). The SFTSV glycoproteins exist in different forms on the virion surface, with Gn-Gc heterodimers capable of assembling into hexons and pentons. To observe the specific binding of mAb 40C10 on the virion surface, we attempted to fit the structure of mAb 40C10 onto the hexon and penton of SFTSV based on the reported structure of the SFTSV virion [ 10 , 11 ]. The root mean square deviation (RMSD) values for the alignment of the Gn in the complex crystal structure with the Gn in the cryo-EM structure of the SFTSV virion were consistently less than 2 A\\u030a ( S4 Fig ) [ 10 ], indicating a high degree of structural similarity. This suggests that the fitting results are reliable. From the fitted structures, it was evident that mAb 40C10 binds well to the Gn protein in both the hexon and penton without any hindrance from the surroundings ( Fig 2B and 2C ). This is in contrast to MAb 4\\u20135, which is influenced by steric hindrance from the Gn protein around the peplomers ( Fig 2D and 2E ). These observations may provide structural evidence for the potent neutralizing activity of mAb 40C10, which can reach picomolar concentrations. Humanization of mAb 40C10 by CDR grafting MAb 40C10 was isolated from mice. To enhance its potential for clinical applications, we subjected mAb 40C10 to humanization ( Fig 3A ). Human germline counterparts with high sequence identity to both the heavy and light chains of mAb 40C10 were searched using NCBI IgBLAST. We selected the top three human germline V regions with the highest identity to the mAb 40C10 heavy chain variable region (VH): IGHV1-46*01 (66.0%), IGHV1-3*01 (66.0%), and IGHV1-2*06 (64.9%). For the mAb 40C10 light chain variable region (VL), we chose the top two germline V regions with the highest identity, IGKV1-33*01 (66.3%) and IGKV4-1*01 (66.3%). For the J region, IGHJ4*02 and IGKJ2*01 were selected, which differed by two and one residues from the VH and VL sequences of mAb 40C10, respectively ( S5 Fig ). Then, we utilized the FR of the human germline noted above as a template, and three CDRs from the mAb 40C10 heavy and light chains were grafted, resulting in three CDR-grafted heavy chains and two CDR-grafted light chains. 10.1371/journal.ppat.1012550.g003 Fig 3 Evaluation of humanized antibodies. (A) Flowchart of antibody humanization. (B) Humanness score of the heavy and light chains of the humanized antibodies. (C) The ratio of the KD value of the humanized antibodies to the KD value of mAb 40C10. (D) The determination of neutralizing activity of the humanized antibodies. (E) The KD values and IC 50 values of the humanized antibodies. Based on the structure of the SFTSV Gn head\\u2013mAb 40C10 complex, we identified critical residues in the FR of templates that could impact the structure of the CDRs, resulting in a loss of affinity, and back mutations were applied to these residues in the CDR-grafted heavy chains and CDR-grafted light chains. Ultimately, we designed three heavy chains and three light chains. Compared to the sequence of mAb 40C10, the three heavy chains had 17, 23, and 25 mutation sites, while the three light chains had 15, 18, and 19 mutation sites. These designed chains were scored for their degree of humanization using the \\u201cHu-mAb\\u201d website [ 31 ]. All the scores exceeded the threshold, indicating that the engineered chains achieved a high level of humanization (Figs 3B and S6 ). Finally, we paired the engineered heavy and light chains in all possible combinations, generating a total of 9 humanized antibodies, designated HAb-11, HAb-12, HAb-13, HAb-21, HAb-22, HAb-23, HAb-31, HAb-32, and HAb-33. In the humanized antibody designation, the first digit represents the heavy chain number, while the second digit represents the light chain number. Characterization of the humanized antibodies To assess the affinity and neutralizing activity of the humanized antibodies, 9 humanized antibodies in human IgG1 form were expressed in HEK293 cells and purified using Protein A affinity chromatography. For use as a control, we also expressed and purified a humanized IgG1 antibody with variable regions of the heavy and light chains from mAb 40C10, named c40C10. Then, we tested the binding affinity between the humanized antibodies and the SFTSV Gn head domain. According to surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analyses, the equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) for mAb 40C10 was 1.35\\u00d710 \\u221210 M ( S7 Fig ). Using the KD of mAb 40C10 as a reference, the KD of c40C10 and the humanized antibodies differed by only approximately 4-fold at most, with the KD of some humanized antibodies (HAb-11 and HAb-31) being lower KD than that of mAb 40C10 (Figs 3C, 3E and S7 ). The binding affinity results showed that the humanized antibodies retained high binding activity to the SFTSV Gn head domain. We further evaluated the neutralization activity of the 9 humanized antibodies against SFTSV. Although there was a reduction in neutralization activity compared to that of mAb 40C10 and c40C10 [ 20 ], with differences ranging from several-fold to more than tenfold, the neutralizing activity remained in the picomolar range ( Fig 3D and 3E ). This result suggested that the humanized antibodies maintained significant neutralization activity. Next, we selected the humanized antibody HAb-23, which had the best neutralizing activity, for in vivo efficacy evaluation. In vivo efficacy evaluation for the humanized antibody To facilitate clinical application, the in vivo efficacy of the humanized antibody HAb-23 against SFTSV infection was evaluated in IFNAR -/- C57BL/6 mice. In this study, given that approximately half of the isolated SFTSV strains were of the C2 genotype, the HBGS13 strain (C2) was used to infect mice at the median lethal dose (LD 50 ) of 50. Prophylactic and therapeutic treatment groups were established and monitored for 12 days. ( Fig 4A ). 10.1371/journal.ppat.1012550.g004 Fig 4 Evaluation of the prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of the humanized antibody in vivo . (A) Experimental design for determining the prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of the humanized antibody in IFNAR -/- C57BL/6 mice. (B) Survival rate (top) and body weight changes (bottom) of infected mice. (C) The viral loads in the livers and spleens of infected mice were measured by qRT\\u2013PCR at 5 d.p.i. (D) Histopathological analyses of humanized antibody HAb-23 treated or untreated infected mice. All mice in the prophylactic and therapeutic treament groups administered HAb-23 or mAb 40C10 survived, and their body weights ranged from 92.98% to 109.97% of the baseline ( Fig 4B ). In contrast, the mice in the PBS control group showed a decrease in body weight at 2 days post-infection (d.p.i.) and began to die at 5 d.p.i. ( Fig 4B ). Furthermore, the levels of viral RNA in the livers and spleens of mice from the HAb-23/mAb 40C10 prophylactic and therapeutic treatment groups were reduced at 5 d.p.i., as determined by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT\\u2013PCR) ( Fig 4C ). In the PBS control group, hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining revealed inflammatory infiltration, scattered hemorrhage, hepatocellular necrosis in the liver, atrophy or loss of white pulp in the spleen, renal interstitial bleeding in the kidney, and thickening of alveolar septa in the lung ( Fig 4D ). Additionally, immunohistochemical examinations revealed the presence of SFTSV NP antigens in the liver and spleen. In contrast, for the HAb-23 prophylactic and therapeutic treatment groups, there was minimal inflammatory infiltration in the liver, slight loss of white pulp in the spleen, minimal interstitial bleeding in the kidney, and localized thickening of the alveolar septa in the lung at 5 d.p.i. ( Fig 4D ). Furthermore, all pathological symptoms were abrogated, and the organs had returned to a normal state by 12 d.p.i. ( Fig 4D ). In addition, only a small amount of SFTSV NP antigen was detected in the liver and spleen at 5 d.p.i., and SFTSV NP antigen was almost undetectable at 12 d.p.i. These results are similar to those observed for the mouse antibody mAb 40C10 group ( S8 Fig ). These findings suggest that the humanized antibody can still effectively protect against SFTSV infection in vivo when administered either prophylactically or therapeutically.\",\n",
      "  \"Discussion\": \"Discussion SFTS is an infectious disease caused by an emerging tick-borne virus known as SFTSV. SFTSV infection primarily results in symptoms such as fever, fatigue, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia. In severe cases, it can lead to multiorgan failure and, ultimately, death, with a mortality rate as high as 30% [ 3 ]. SFTSV infection has become a globally significant public health concern, and several research groups have reported the development of DNA vaccines, mRNA vaccines, nanoparticle vaccines, neutralizing antibodies, and nanobodies targeting SFTSV [ 16 , 18 , 19 , 32 \\u2013 35 ]. However, there are currently no approved specific vaccines or antibody drugs against SFTSV for clinical use. We previously identified the mAb 40C10, which has potent neutralizing activity, and demonstrated its effective protection in vivo [ 20 ]. Nevertheless, the precise molecular mechanism of action for this antibody remains unclear. In this study, we analyzed the structure of the SFTSV Gn head\\u2013mAb 40C10 complex to identify the binding epitope of mAb 40C10. Remarkably, mAb 40C10 binds to domain I of SFTSV Gn, which is distinct from the previously identified binding site. This discovery revealed a novel binding epitope on SFTSV Gn. Besides, hydrogen bond interaction between mAb 40C10 and the glycan molecules of the N-linked glycosylation site N63 of Gn was observed. This glycosylation site is conserved across different genotypes of SFTSV ( S2A and S2B Fig ), and glycan modification at this site has been observed in several resolved structure of SFTSV Gn [ 11 , 17 ]. These observations suggest that the interaction between the antibody and SFTSV Gn is conserved and that glycosylation at this site may play a critical role in antibody binding. Sequence alignment of different SFTSV genotypes shows that the binding epitope of mAb 40C10 is conserved, which is consistent with its effective neutralizing effect against various SFTSV genotypes in vitro [ 20 ]. Similarly, the critical binding epitopes of mAb 4\\u20135 and Ab10 in the Gn head domain are conserved across different SFTSV genotypes ( S9A and S9B Fig ) [ 17 , 18 ], suggesting that mAb 4\\u20135 and Ab10 might also broadly neutralize different SFTSV genotypes. Experimental data indicate that mAb 40C10 can cross-neutralize HRTV and GTV, with sequence analysis revealing that its binding epitope is relatively conserved in these SFTSV-related viruses. However, the critical binding epitopes of mAb 4\\u20135 show lower conservation in HRTV and GTV ( S9C Fig ), indicating potentially weaker neutralization activity against these viruses. In contrast, the binding epitopes of Ab10 in the Gn head domain is relatively conserved in HRTV and GTV ( S9C Fig ), suggesting possible neutralization of these viruses. Further experimental validation is needed to confirm whether mAb 4\\u20135 and Ab10 possess broad-spectrum neutralizing activity against different genotypes of SFTSV and SFTSV-related viruses. Based on the cryo-EM structure of the SFTSV virion [ 10 , 11 ], the structure and assembly of the glycoproteins Gn and Gc on the virus membrane can be clearly observed. In light of the characteristics of this structure, we investigated the binding regions of mAb 40C10, MAb 4\\u20135 and Ab10 on SFTSV Gn. As shown in Fig 2A , MAb 4\\u20135 binds to domain III of SFTSV Gn [ 17 ], and this interaction is influenced by steric hindrance from adjacent Gn/Gc heterodimers. Similarly, the binding epitope of Ab10 is located in domain II of SFTSV Gn, near the stem region [ 18 ], and this interaction is potentially affected by steric hindrance from the viral membrane. Therefore, we speculate that MAb 4\\u20135 and Ab10 bind to SFTSV Gn during the membrane fusion process, specifically when Gn and Gc undergo conformational changes under acidic pH conditions in the endosome. In contrast, the binding site of mAb 40C10 is not affected by surrounding Gn/Gc heterodimers or the membrane, and each Gn in the hexon or penton can bind to mAb 40C10 ( Fig 2B and 2C ). Consequently, we hypothesize that mAb 40C10 may bind to Gn without Gn/Gc heterodimers undergoing conformational changes, thereby facilitating inhibition of viral infection. Neutralizing antibodies against enveloped virus can exert their effects through multiple mechanisms [ 36 ]. Studies have shown that by analyzing the cryo-EM structures of three anti-Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) neutralizing human mAbs bound to EEEV, the distance between Fab regions bound to glycoprotein spikes can elucidate the mechanism of neutralization through intravirion or intervirion cross-links [ 37 ]. Similarly, mAb 40C10 may neutralize SFTSV, an icosahedral virus, through a mechanism involving virion cross-linking. We fitted mAb 40C10 to the surface of SFTSV at the 2-fold, 3-fold, and 5-fold symmetry axes and measured the distances between the CH1 domain ends of two adjacent mAb 40C10 Fabs. The distances ranged from 62.7 A\\u030a to 140.1 A\\u030a, all of which are greater than the distance between the two Fabs of an IgG molecule [ 38 ] ( S10A, S10B and S10C Fig ). This observation suggests that mAb 40C10 might form intervirion cross-links. To further substantiate this hypothesis, we measured the IC 50 values of mAb 40C10 in both its IgG and Fab forms ( S10D Fig ). The significantly better neutralization effect observed with the IgG form compared to the Fab form supports the hypothesis that the potential neutralization mechanism of mAb 40C10 involves intervirion cross-linking. Furthermore, we also fitted mAb 4\\u20135 onto the SFTSV surface and found that its epitope is located internally rather than on the surface ( S11 Fig ). Thus, mAb 4\\u20135 may not bind to Gn or form virion cross-links before the conformational changes in SFTSV glycoproteins. To further understand the neutralizing mechanism of mAb 40C10, we first explored whether mAb 40C10 affects the virus attachment to cells. Experimental results showed that the amount of virus adsorbed to the cells in the PBS group and the mAb 40C10 group was similar, with no significant difference ( S12A Fig ). Previous studies have demonstrated that SFTSV enters cells through endocytosis into the cytoplasm, followed by membrane fusion with the late endosome membrane in the acidic environment, which releases the virus to complete the invasion process [ 39 ]. Based on these characteristics of SFTSV invasion of cells, we investigated whether the antibody affects virus endocytosis. During the early stage of virus adsorption, consistent with the previous steps, we added NH 4 Cl to the cell culture medium, which can inhibit the fusion of the virus with the endosome membrane [ 40 ]. The experimental results showed that the amount of virus entering the cells in the mAb 40C10 group was significantly lower than that in the PBS group ( S12B Fig ), suggesting that the antibody affected the internalization process of SFTSV. These observations, combined with the data suggesting that mAb 40C10 might form intervirion cross-links, lead us to hypothesize that mAb 40C10 may not interfere with the binding of the virus to cell receptors. Instead, it may form cross-links between virions outside the cell, causing them to aggregate. This aggregation could result in larger particle sizes or other effects that hinder viral internalization, thereby preventing the virus from entering and infecting the cells. However, this hypothesis requires further experimental validation. Neutralizing antibodies directly target viral proteins, thereby affecting the interaction between the virus and host cells, ultimately inhibiting viral infection and preventing or treating viral infectious disease. The extensive development and clinical application of neutralizing antibodies during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic have propelled their application in the treatment of viral diseases [ 41 ]. The screening of neutralizing antibodies from immunized mice is a common method. The application of murine monoclonal antibodies in clinical settings requires humanization to mitigate the inherent immunogenicity associated with murine antibodies. Several humanized antibodies have already been approved for clinical use [ 27 , 28 ]. Consequently, the humanization of antibodies has emerged as a crucial technological pathway in the development of clinical antibody therapeutics. In this study, we employed CDR grafting and backmutation to humanize the mouse antibody mAb 40C10. Nine humanized antibodies were designed, and they maintained favorable affinity and neutralizing activity. Furthermore, we selected the humanized antibody HAb-23, which had superior neutralizing activity, for evaluation of its efficacy in SFTSV animal infection models. The results demonstrated that similar to the mouse antibody mAb 40C10, the humanized antibody HAb-23 retained potent therapeutic and protective effects. Although we assessed the degree of humanization and observed a reduction in immunogenicity compared to that of the mouse antibody, the immunogenicity still needs to be further experimentally investigated and clinically evaluated to ensure the safety of the humanized antibody. With the rapid advancement of AI computational methods, the design of humanized antibodies can now begin with the use of predicted structural models and Rosetta atomic simulations to aid in the selection of designs with optimal energy and structural integrity [ 42 ], thereby shortening the antibody design cycle. This approach provides us with new technological methods to expedite the humanization of antibodies in the future. However, thorough testing through in vitro and in vivo experiments is still needed to comprehensively assess the functionality of the designed humanized antibodies. While the manuscript was under peer-review, Chang et al. reported several neutralizing antibodies targeting SFTSV glycoproteins, including one that interact with domain I of SFTSV Gn [ 43 ]. Structural comparison clearly shows that mAb 40C10 and SF5 recognize different epitopes on domain I, with no overlap between the two ( S13A Fig ). The affinity and neutralizing activity of mAb 40C10 against Gn surpass those of SF5. This may be because the epitope of SF5 is hidden within the penton/hexon, while the epitope of mAb 40C10 is located on the external surface of the penton/hexon, allowing mAb 40C10 to bind more effectively to each Gn in the penton/hexon ( S13B and S13C Fig ). In animal experiment, Chang et al. used a challenge dose of 50,000 LD 50 and tested the protective effects of different antibody doses [ 43 ]. A dose of 5 mg/kg of SF5 achieved 100% prophylactic protection, and a dose of 10 mg/kg achieved 100% therapeutic efficacy. Unfortunately, we did not experiment with different doses of mAb 40C10 to determine the minimum dose required for effective prophylactic and therapeutic effects. This aspect will be addressed in future studies to better understand the optimal dosing strategy. In conclusion, we elucidated the structure of the SFTSV Gn head\\u2013mAb 40C10 Fab complex. This study provides insights into the molecular mechanism underlying the broad-spectrum neutralizing activity of mAb 40C10 and reveals a previously unreported potent and broad-spectrum neutralizing epitope of SFTSV Gn, providing a new target for subsequent vaccine and drug design. Additionally, we humanized of mAb 40C10, producing the humanized antibody HAb-23, which maintained potent binding and neutralizing activity. HAb-23 demonstrated effective therapeutic and protective effects in an animal infection model. These findings lay the foundation for the development of antibody therapeutics for clinical applications.\"\n",

      "  \"Abstract\": \"Modular and distributed coding theories of category selectivity along the human ventral visual stream have long existed in tension. Here, we present a reconciling framework\\u2014contrastive coding\\u2014based on a series of analyses relating category selectivity within biological and artificial neural networks. We discover that, in models trained with contrastive self-supervised objectives over a rich natural image diet, category-selective tuning naturally emerges for faces, bodies, scenes, and words. Further, lesions of these model units lead to selective, dissociable recognition deficits, highlighting their distinct functional roles in information processing. Finally, these pre-identified units can predict neural responses in all corresponding face-, scene-, body-, and word-selective regions of human visual cortex, under a highly constrained sparse positive encoding procedure. The success of this single model indicates that brain-like functional specialization can emerge without category-specific learning pressures, as the system learns to untangle rich image content. Contrastive coding, therefore, provides a unifying account of object category emergence and representation in the human brain.\",\n",
      "  \"Introduction\": \"INTRODUCTION Our ability to see and recognize objects, people, and the broader environment around us is supported by representations along the ventral visual stream ( 1 \\u2013 6 ). Foundational discoveries have charted regions with category-selective tuning, evident for a few categories: faces ( 7 \\u2013 10 ), bodies ( 11 , 12 ), scenes ( 13 \\u2013 15 ), and visually presented words ( 16 \\u2013 18 ). That is, recorded responses in single units and voxels respond systematically more on average to the neurons\\u2019 preferred category (e.g., images of faces), with only weak responses to other categories. The properties of these regions and the pressures guiding their emergence has been the subject of intense study for decades ( 19 \\u2013 31 ). What is the nature of the tuning in these regions that supports the selective responses across images? In addition, are these category-selective regions better understood distinctly from each other and the representation of other categories, or as interrelated regions that are part of a broader visual representational scheme? A prominent view of these brain regions is as distinctive, independent, functional modules ( 3 , 19 , 32 \\u2013 36 ). Category-selective regions only exist for a few domains and are thus hypothesized to be different from other visual categories in some important way. For example, for faces, bodies, and scenes, these categories may have particular ecological relevance and may emerge through built-in specialized architectures, supporting domain-specialized tasks such as face individuation ( 20 , 37 \\u2013 39 ). For the case of word selectivity, perhaps extensive visual training and a need to interface with long-range connectivity to language regions lead to the emergence of regions such as the visual word-form area ( 40 \\u2013 42 ). Brain regions with selectivities for different categories are typically studied in depth by different communities and are assumed to have very different kinds of visual feature tuning from one another, related purely to their distinct domains (e.g., face-specialized, body-specialized, scene-specialized, and word-specialized). Some of the strongest evidence for the modularity of these regions comes from selective deficits following brain damage ( 43 \\u2013 50 ) or other forms of causal perturbation such as transcranial magnetic stimulation ( 51 \\u2013 53 ), electrical microstimulation ( 54 ), and pharmacological inactivation ( 55 ); see ( 56 ) for review. In this way, modular frameworks specify a \\u201clabeled-line\\u201d type of visual representation ( 57 ), where, for example, a neuron\\u2019s highly selective firing rates to face images are a direct indicator of its functional role in face processing. However, modular accounts are restricted to explaining the representation of a few specific visual categories. Empirical evidence shows that not all visual categories have clustered areas of highly selective tuning along the ventral stream ( 58 \\u2013 60 ), leaving unspecified how all other categories are represented. Distributed coding accounts are the prominent alternative framework, where the relevant category information is assumed to be encoded in the activation pattern of the large-scale neural population ( 2 , 61 \\u2013 63 ). Under this view, across the population of neurons, both high and low responses are critical to signal category information (much like how both 1\\u2019s and 0\\u2019s encode information in a binary code). These accounts sometimes assume the underlying visual feature tuning of units in object-responsive cortex is either fairly generic [e.g., geons or other building-block\\u2013like contours that apply to many categories to some degree; ( 64 )] or that the tuning of any one unit may not be particularly interpretable without the context of the full population code ( 5 ). This latter perspective is a key element in untangling theories, which tend to de-emphasize the interpretation of the response properties of local units or features, in favor of studying the broader geometry of the population ( 65 ). The strongest empirical evidence for a distributed representational account comes from the pervasive category information present across regions of high-level visual cortex ( 2 , 6 , 60 , 62 , 66 \\u2013 68 ). For example, both face and non-face categories can be decoded from both face-selective regions and non-face selective regions ( 2 , 69 ). However, it is debated whether this extensive decodable information is all functionally relevant for recognition behavior ( 70 \\u2013 73 ). These modular and distributed representational accounts have continued to develop in parallel, each contributing to a set of empirical puzzle pieces that constrain our understanding of category selectivity along ventral visual cortex. To date, it remains unclear the extent to which these theories are compatible or opposed. For example, one possibility is that there may simply be two modes of representation in the visual system, where a few special categories have more domain-specialized tuning and localist readout schemes, while all others have more generic tuning with accompanying distributed readout schemes. However, further pieces of empirical and computational evidence hint at a deeper unifying relationship between categories with selective regions and the representation of other objects\\u2014for example, based on their systematic topographic relationships on the cortical surface ( 23 , 25 , 28 , 74 \\u2013 76 ). Along these lines, here, we offer an updated account of category-selective regions, which provides specific insight into both the nature of their feature tuning and their function in the context of information readout. To do so, we leverage a particular kind of deep convolutional neural network model (DNN) to operationalize this unifying perspective. Specifically, we used self-supervised instance-level contrastive learning objectives ( 77 , 78 ) to train a standard DNN architecture over a large, rich set of natural images ( 79 , 80 ). The contrastive learning objective does not prioritize any special categories over other object categories, nor does it even presuppose object categories at all. Instead, these self-supervised contrastive models learn to represent every experienced image distinctly from every other image in an embedding space [while being similar to itself under some transformations; see also ( 81 \\u2013 84 )]. As a consequence, these models develop emergent category-level representations: Images with similar visual characteristics tend to come from similar categories and thus are naturally routed through the hierarchy to nearby locations in the representational space. A key property of contrastive objectives, relevant for the work here, is that the nature of the learned features is intrinsically diet-dependent. This notion of \\u201cdiet\\u201d refers to the range of content depicted in the input samples that ultimately govern a model\\u2019s learned features. For example, training a contrastive model that experiences only images of faces will yield feature tuning that aims to discriminate among face image content [e.g., ( 85 , 86 )]. Training the model over a richer visual diet, like the ImageNet dataset used here, will provide learned features that aim to discriminate among all 1.2 million images [e.g., ( 81 )]. The set of training images in contrastive models is critical for determining the nature of the learned feature tuning. An important related point is that the set of units within a layer, as a whole, must jointly represent the entire input space. Therefore, the feature tuning of any single unit is influenced not just by the learning diet but also by the tuning of other units in the same layer. In these ways, the feature tuning of each unit in contrastive networks is meaningfully linked to both the scope of visual input and the tuning of other units within and across layers. Leveraging these contrastive self-supervised models, the aim of the present work is to provide a possible computational explanation of the emergence and function of category-selective tuning, with purely domain-general learning constraints. We show that a contrastive DNN model has emergent category-selective units, which lead to selective and dissociable recognition deficits when lesioned, and which can predict the high-dimensional response structure of diverse category-selective regions in the human brain. We further introduce a sparse positive-weighted voxel encoding scheme, which reflects a more constrained linking procedure between biological and artificial neural network responses, under the hypothesis that the tuning directions of single model units (and neurons) are key for signaling image content. Broadly, we argue that category-selective regions are facets of a rich, diet-dependent, contrastive feature space. To propose a mechanistic account for these signatures, we introduce the concept of positive routing through hierarchical population codes, where units with different tuning serve to channel different content through successive stages into an increasingly untangled latent space.\",\n",

      "  \"Results\": \"RESULTS Category-selective tuning emerges in models without category-specialized mechanisms We first examined whether a contrastive DNN trained without any category-specific architectural motifs or task objectives would show emergent category-selective signatures that mirror those observed in the human ventral visual stream. Note that our use of the term \\u201ccategory selectivity\\u201d throughout is specifically referring to the categories (domains) of faces, bodies, scenes, and visual word forms, following the well-characterized category-selective regions of the ventral stream. We used a popular self-supervised learning objective [Barlow Twins; ( 77 )] to train a standard deep convolutional neural network model architecture [AlexNet; ( 79 )] using the ImageNet dataset ( 80 ). Barlow Twins attempts to minimize the difference in latent space between different augmentations of an image, outputting a high-dimensional embedding of maximally independent dimensions. Although the Barlow Twins algorithm is sometimes described as energy or covariance based rather than contrastive ( 87 ), it effectively functions as contrastive with respect to encoding dimensions, yielding representations that distinguish between instances [see Materials and Methods; ( 88 , 89 )]. To test for emergent category-selective tuning in the self-supervised model, we designed procedures to mirror the localization of category-selective regions in the human ventral visual stream in typical functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments. Specifically, we recorded the activations of every model unit in response to the same localizer image set ( 90 ) used to identify category-selective regions in the Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD) ( 91 ) and then performed a statistical contrast to identify nonoverlapping sets of model units that were selective for faces, bodies, scenes, and words ( Fig. 1A ; see Materials and Methods). This procedure was run separately for every layer of the model, treating pre- and post-rectified activations as distinct computational stages. Fig. 1. Emergent category selectivity in a self-supervised DNN. ( A ) Localizer procedure for identifying category-selective units in the self-supervised model. ( B ) Pie charts summarize proportions of model units selective for faces, bodies, objects, scenes, and words in model layers conv1 to conv5 and fc6 (enlarged). ( C ) Responses in model layer fc6 to the color probe set of face, body, scene, word, and object stimuli. n = 80 images per domain. Layer fc6 units ( y axis) are sorted according to their selectivities as defined using the independent localizer stimuli. The 400-dimensional activation profile of each unit is z -scored for purposes of visualization. Images containing identifiable human faces are masked. With this localizer procedure, we were able to identify small groups of category-selective units in each layer with either robust face selectivity, place selectivity, body selectivity, or word selectivity [false discovery rate (FDR) corrected, P < 0.05; mean unit t value for faces = 9.29 \\u00b1 4.47 SD; scenes = 8.86 \\u00b1 3.34; bodies = 7.38 \\u00b1 2.17; and words = 8.12 \\u00b1 2.74]. The overall proportions of selective units tended to significantly increase across the model hierarchy [Spearman correlation coefficient ( r ) = 0.81 between layer index and total proportion of selective units; see figs. S1A and S3A]. The relative strengths of these units\\u2019 selectivities also increased significantly as a function of depth (Spearman r = 0.92 between layer index and the mean localizer t value within all selective units; see fig. S2A). Further, note that, even in a single layer (e.g., fc6), it was possible to find different units with selectivity for each domain ( Fig. 1B ). Thus, distinct category-selective units emerge in the context of a single population code, as operationalized by a hierarchical layer. We next tested whether the units\\u2019 selectivities generalized to an alternate standard localizer image set. This independent probe set consisted of 400 total images of faces, bodies, scenes, words, and objects and differed in both low-level image statistics (e.g., color instead of grayscale) and high-level image content (e.g., containing diverse object types instead of only cars and guitars in the \\u201cobject\\u201d category). We observed that the selective units maintained their high responses to preferred stimuli (see Fig. 1C and fig. S3B), suggesting that their category-selective tuning is robust and not dependent on a specific probe image set, as is also the case in the human brain. Thus, emergent category-selective tuning is found in a self-supervised DNN model. Do these signatures of category selectivity depend strongly on the specifics of the localizer method? We tested an alternate procedure, this time identifying units whose mean response to the preferred category is at least two times higher than the mean response to each of the non-preferred categories ( 92 ). In some layers, this 2:1 approach proved slightly more conservative than the t test method, while in others, it was more lenient (fig. S3A). However, the selective units arising from these two procedures showed highly similar mean activation profiles when probed with independent localizer images (fig. S3B). Does category-selective tuning emerge in models trained with other related objectives? In an AlexNet model trained with a different contrastive learning objective [instance-prototype contrastive learning (IPCL); ( 78 ); see Materials and Methods], we again observed units across the model with robust selective tuning for each domain, although fewer units selective for bodies (fig. S1B). Further, an AlexNet model trained using a supervised 1000-way ImageNet classification objective also showed emergent category-selective tuning for the domains of interest (fig. S1C). Note that the 1000-way supervised objective is also richly contrastive in nature ( 81 , 93 ); its goal is to learn a highly discriminative feature space that can distinguish among many different subordinate categories. However, here, we place particular focus on the results of self-supervised contrastive models, for their broader capacity to learn over arbitrary visual inputs without labels, and their added inferential purchase: With self-supervised contrastive models, we can definitively state that no category-level objectives are required for category-selective tuning to emerge. Finally, because prior reports have indicated that units with face-selective tuning can emerge even in untrained networks ( 94 ), we also localized category-selective units in a randomly initialized AlexNet architecture ( Fig. 1B and fig. S1D). We found that there were substantially fewer than in trained networks (e.g., 14.6% versus 35.7% of total layer fc6 units selective for either faces, bodies, scenes, or words in untrained versus trained models), the strength of these units\\u2019 selectivities was far weaker (e.g., fc6 mean t value across domains = 6.6 versus 13.4; fig. S2A), and their response properties did not generalize to the independent probe set (fig. S2B). These results jointly suggest that training (i.e., visual experience) is necessary for DNN features to develop reliable selectivities for these high-level domains of interest. In summary, the fMRI-inspired localizer procedure was able to identify category-selective DNN units in self-supervised contrastive models. These results demonstrate that units with category-selective tuning to faces, bodies, scenes, and words can emerge as a general consequence of contrastive learning over a rich natural image diet (as reflected in the ImageNet stimulus set). We emphasize that no categorical, semantic, or other domain-specific learning pressures were involved in training these models. Lesioning category-selective units yields dissociable, predictable deficits Next, we examined the functional role these category-selective DNN units have for image recognition. Neurophysiological evidence has shown that dissociable recognition deficits arise from perturbation of category-selective areas along the ventral visual stream ( 45 , 53 , 54 ), supporting the idea that they reflect distinct functional modules [e.g., ( 3 , 7 )]. If these selective units are also acting as functional modules within the contrastive DNN, then lesioning the units with face selectivity (i.e., setting their activations to 0) should yield a very different profile of recognition deficits than lesioning the units with scene selectivity. Alternatively, these category-selective units may be tuned arbitrarily in the layer\\u2019s feature space and show no clear functional dissociations with respect to the model\\u2019s recognition behavior when lesioned. To explore the impact of lesioning category-selective model units, we first needed to instantiate a readout mechanism to measure the object recognition capacity of the DNN. Note that the self-supervised model is trained only to learn features that discriminate any image view from any other view. How is category information read out from this rich visual feature space? Traditional practices and theoretical frameworks have focused on linear separability of object classes across the full population code (i.e., in the penultimate layer), which is assessed by learning a set of fully connected readout weights for each category (a distributed readout scheme). However, here, we constrained this procedure by adding sparsity regularization (L1 penalty) to the readout weights. This approach operationalizes a view where category information can be accessed without requiring connections between every neuron in the population and each category node. We offer that this readout method provides a more theoretically constrained and biologically plausible connectivity motif (see Discussion). Note that all results below hold with the standard, more flexible fully connected readout method. This regularized linear readout function was trained for 10 epochs on top of the penultimate layer embedding (relu7; frozen backbone), and we then measured the baseline recognition accuracy for each of the 1000 ImageNet categories (see Fig. 2A ). Averaging across categories, the mean top-5 classification accuracy was 61.5 \\u00b1 20.3% SD. The learned readout weights were extremely sparse (85.4% of weights with absolute magnitude < 0.001 versus 5.4% from unregularized readout with the same hyperparameters), with only a negligible resulting drop in top-5 accuracy of \\u22120.95% compared to unregularized readout. Fig. 2. Impact of lesioning category-selective units on object recognition behavior. ( A ) Procedure for measuring object recognition deficits from lesions to category-selective units in the self-supervised model. Baseline top-5 recognition accuracy is assessed via sparse readout from relu7 features. Recognition deficits reflect the drop in categorization accuracy following lesions to category-selective units from each domain. ( B ) Top four categories with greatest recognition deficits are shown for lesions to face-, scene-, body-, and word-selective units. Plotted exemplars are chosen from the ImageNet validation set and labeled with drop in top-5 accuracy between baseline and lesioned validation passes. ( C ) Bar graphs show the mean (\\u00b1 SEM) change in top-5 accuracy over the top 10 categories most affected by lesions to the selective units of each domain. ( D ) Relationship between category activation and lesioning cost for face-, body-, scene-, and word-selective units. Dots reflect the 1000 ImageNet categories. The x axis shows mean activation levels for each category (layer relu6 plotted) from the unlesioned model. The y axis shows change in top-5 accuracy after lesioning. Colored points reflect the top 10 categories most affected by lesions to each domain. Y values are jittered (values drawn from normal distribution; mean, 0; SD, 0.5%) to enhance visibility of the results. Photo credit: Images in (B) are samples from the public ImageNet validation set, and those containing human faces are masked. We next carried out the main lesion experiments. Specifically, we lesioned all of the face-selective units across the model\\u2019s relu layers (or body-selective units, or scene-selective units, etc.) and measured the change in recognition accuracy for each ImageNet category after each type of lesion. To what degree did these distinct lesions produce dissociable deficits? To answer this question, we computed the 1000-dimensional cost profiles for each lesion as the difference between unlesioned and lesioned top-5 accuracies for each category. Then, we compared these cost profiles between all pairs of lesions. The cost profiles were broadly unrelated and, in some cases, negatively related: For example, the face-versus-scene cost profile correlation was r = \\u22120.21, the face-versus-word correlation was r = \\u22120.08, and the average correlation between domain pairs was r = 0.02 \\u00b1 0.13 SD (see fig. S5, B and C). Thus, it is clear that these different groups of category-selective units have dissociable causal involvement in the recognition of different ImageNet categories. Which ImageNet categories suffered the greatest recognition deficits for each type of lesion ( Fig. 2B )? It was not obvious a priori which categories would be most affected by each lesion type, especially as ImageNet lacks explicit \\u201cface,\\u201d \\u201cbody,\\u201d \\u201cscene,\\u201d and \\u201cword\\u201d categories, and the ImageNet database was not used in the unit-localization procedure in any way. We observed that lesions to face-selective units led to the strongest deficits for several dog breed categories, as well as object categories containing people, such as \\u201cseat belt\\u201d and \\u201ccradle\\u201d; body-selective unit lesions led to the strongest deficits for animals and articles of clothing; scene-selective unit lesions led to deficits for certain place categories and large object categories; and word-selective unit lesions led to deficits in recognizing insect categories, as well as objects such as \\u201cpadlock,\\u201d \\u201cwallet,\\u201d and \\u201cdust jacket\\u201d (see fig. S4 for detailed summary of the most affected categories per lesion). To quantify the strength and selectivity of these deficits, we measured the degree of impairment for the top 10 categories most affected by each lesion type. We used a cross-validation procedure (see Materials and Methods) to guard against circularity, ensuring that separate images were used to first identify the sensitive categories and then to quantify their lesioning deficits. We observed striking multi-way dissociations; for example, the top 10 categories most affected by lesioning face units (mean impact: \\u221253.2% top-5 accuracy) were broadly unaffected by lesions to scene-units (mean impact: +2.4% top-5 accuracy), with similar trends for the other domains ( Fig. 2C and fig. S5A). These analyses underscore the distinct functional roles that these selective units play within the deep neural network. The observed impairments bear promising relation to existing findings. For example, fMRI studies have shown that animal images elicit a moderate-to-high response in face-selective regions, and that large object categories elicit moderate-to-high responses in scene-selective regions ( 3 , 27 , 95 ). Intriguingly, the occipital word-form area has also been shown to exhibit stronger responses to insects compared to other object classes like chairs or cars ( 96 ). The fact that our word-unit lesions highlight insect categories may simply be due to the relative scarcity of letter and word content within ImageNet. However, the link between our results and those in ( 96 ) hints at another possibility: Early experience with thin-lined objects (such as insects) could act as a scaffold for the later formation of letter and word representations. These results set the stage for deeper inquiry into whether causal perturbations of category-selective regions in biological visual system show similar profiles of graded deficits over these images, or, whether they are more specific to a few privileged categories. Is there a way to predict which ImageNet categories will be most affected by each lesion? We hypothesized that if a category drives a set of units substantially during normal operation, then its recognition should be substantially impaired when those units are lesioned. That is, we hypothesized that higher activation would be a reliable indicator of greater functional involvement within the network. To test this idea, we examined whether the ImageNet categories that most activated the face-selective units were also the hardest to recognize after lesioning (and similarly for all the other domains). We first calculated the mean activation for each of the 1000 ImageNet categories without lesions, by averaging the activations of the 50 validation set images per category within a given group of selective units. Then, after lesioning those units, we took each category and computed how much its recognition accuracy (again assessed using the validation set) changed due to the lesion. The relationship between these changes in accuracy and the pre-lesion activity levels is plotted for each lesion type in Fig. 2D . We observed consistent negative correlations (mean r = \\u22120.57 \\u00b1 0.08 SD)\\u2014the more an ImageNet category activated a group of category-selective units, the more difficult it was to recognize that category after lesioning. This effect held across layers; see fig. S6A. The strength and consistency of this relationship implies that positive activation magnitude is a reasonably reliable indicator of functional relevance. As a key control analysis, we tested the impact of lesioning randomized groups of units. The entire procedure was repeated, this time targeting randomized indices of units that were numerically matched to the size of category-selective subsets in each relu layer. In this regime, we no longer observed meaningful variation in the degree of recognition deficits across categories. As a result, the correlations between activation magnitude and subsequent deficits after lesioning dropped to near zero (fig. S6B). Thus, systematic deficits for some categories over others only occur when lesioning cohesive sets of similarly tuned units across the layers. We also verified that these relationships between activation and recognition deficit were not tied to the specifics of our localizer and lesioning methods. We repeated the analysis using face-selective units chosen via the 2:1 response ratio method, finding equally strong relationships between unit activations and lesion impact (Pearson r = \\u22120.61 for both localizer methods; fig. S7, A and B). Similar trends were observed when lesioning just the top 1% of most face-selective units from each relu layer ( r = \\u22120.54; fig. S7C) and when targeting only the face-selective units of layer relu6 ( r = \\u22120.60; fig. S7D). Last, to more directly test for a causal link between selective units across the model hierarchy, we silenced only face-selective units from layers relu1 through relu5 (leaving subsequent layers unperturbed). Then, we measured the activation levels to the color probe localizer images in layer relu6 and observed a strong decrease in activation to face images relative to the other categories (fig. S8A). The same trends held for the other domains (fig. S8, B to D), suggesting that these similarly tuned groups of units have a meaningful functional link across the DNN layers. Overall, these analyses show that predictable recognition deficits arise from targeting groups of similarly tuned units, regardless of their specific locations within the model. These lesion experiments have two key implications. First, these results demonstrate that functionally dissociable deficits can occur even with a domain-general contrastive objective, and within a general architecture (with no prespecified modular pathways or branches). Our results imply that, during training, the model weights effectively form separable routes through the layer hierarchy, directing different kinds of image content to separable locations in the final embedding space. Second, these analyses reveal a link between a unit\\u2019s activation magnitude and its functional relevance in recognition behavior. We hypothesize that this is partially a consequence of the relu nonlinearity, where information propagates from layer to layer through positive activation only. Linking model and brain tuning with sparse positive encoding constraints All experiments conducted so far have focused on a DNN model, identifying units with category-selective tuning, and charting their dissociable functional roles. How similar are the representations in these category-selective model units to the category-selective regions of the brain? We next test the hypothesis that these pre-identified sets of model units from a single contrastive model can capture the response profiles and representational geometries of the classic category-selective regions. This departs from many prior approaches, which typically focus on only one category (e.g., only faces or only scenes), often using category-specialized feature models [e.g., models that apply only to faces; ( 97 \\u2013 100 )], and, from approaches that train separate end-to-end DNN models to predict each brain region of interest (ROI) independently ( 30 ). Instead, here we test the hypothesis that the nature of the feature tuning across all category-selective regions can be understood jointly, within a single model, as a consequence of contrastive feature learning over a rich image diet, in order to distinguish all kinds of visual content. While most standard approaches model each brain voxel as a linear combination of all features from a DNN layer, we instead fit encoding models for each category-selective region using only the subsets of DNN units with corresponding selectivity (e.g., only face-selective units are used for modeling face-selective regions; Fig. 3A ). Further, we impose a second constraint on the encoding procedure, requiring that all learned encoding weights be sparse and positive ( Fig. 3B ). Thus, for example, face-selective voxels can only be fit using a minimal positively weighted combination of face-selective model units. These added forms of regularization strongly enhance the interpretability of the linking function ( 101 ). Fig. 3. Sparse positive-weighted encoding models of category-selective ROIs. ( A ) Schematic of the brain-model encoding procedure. DNN units and ROI surface vertices with corresponding selectivity are mapped to one-another via positive weighted linear regression, and weights are regularized to be sparse (L1 penalty). ( B ) Impact of the positive weight constraint. In predicting a given brain vertex (e.g., from FFA, shaded red), DNN units with anticorrelated tuning directions to the target (e.g., from scene-selective units, dark green) cannot contribute to encoding fits. We introduce the sparse positivity constraint on the encoding weights to help ensure that the learned tuning directions between model units and voxels are relatively aligned and in correspondence with each other. Positivity is important, as for example, scene-selective and face-selective voxels often have negatively correlated response profiles; standard linking procedures (e.g., linear regression) can apply negative weights to scene-selective DNN units to adequately model face-selective voxels (see figs. S11 and S12). Sparsity is also important, to pressure toward as close to a one-to-one alignment between the learned tuning in models and voxels/neurons as possible, and to reduce the amount of feature remixing that happens through the linking procedure. In a way, here we have already implemented a hard sparsity constraint by restricting our voxel-wise encoding models to include only a small prespecified set of units from the layer. However, there are many face-selective voxels and face-selective units, so the additional L1 regularization pushes for an even tighter alignment between voxel tuning and DNN units. Together, these constraints help operationalize the underlying theory of the contrastive account, where the tuning directions of a DNN are meaningfully oriented in the population space, and correspond to the tuning evident across high-level visual cortex. Category-selective units account for representational signatures of category-selective ROIs For our encoding analyses, we used the open-source NSD ( 91 ), targeting a set of 11 category-selective regions (fig. S9A). These include three face-selective areas: fusiform face area 1 (FFA-1), fusiform face area 2 (FFA-2), and the occipital face area (OFA); three body-selective areas: extrastriate body area (EBA), fusiform body area 1 (FBA-1), and fusiform body area 2 (FBA-2); two scene-selective areas: parahippocampal place area (PPA) and occipital place area (OPA); and, three regions selective for visual word forms (hereafter referred to as \\u201cword-selective\\u201d areas): visual word form area 1 (VWFA-1), visual word form area 2 (VWFA-2), and the occipital word form area (OWFA). All analyses were performed separately for each individual subject. For each voxel in each region, we fit a regularized (sparse positive-weighted) encoding model from the pre-identified model units in each layer with corresponding selectivity, using data from 1000 training images. Using an independent set of 1000 validation images, we then ran a within-subject cross-validation procedure to identify the most predictive layer (see Materials and Methods). Finally, we used these voxel-wise encoding models to generate predicted activations to a test set of 515 images that was shared across subjects (fig. S9B). Our two key outcome measures were the correlation between the predicted and measured univariate response profiles (515 images) and multivariate representational dissimilarity matrices (RDMs; 132,355 pairwise comparisons). Thus, NSD offers a substantially richer characterization of item-level representational structure in each region than has previously been possible (although there are also clear limitations of this test set; see Discussion). Figure 4 shows results for a primary set of four ROIs (FFA-1, PPA, EBA, and VWFA-1) for both univariate response profiles and multivariate RDMs. We found that the face-, scene-, body-, and word-selective model units each accounted for substantial structure in their corresponding brain regions for both univariate responses (e.g., eight-subject mean best-layer r = 0.58 for FFA-1, r = 0.69 for PPA, r = 0.48 for EBA, and r = 0.28 for VWFA-1) as well as multivariate responses (e.g., eight-subject mean best-layer r = 0.47 for FFA-1, r = 0.46 for PPA, r = 0.45 for EBA, and r = 0.41 for VWFA-1). Here, we plot the results from the best-fitting layer; however, we note that units from several mid-to-high layers achieved comparable levels of prediction; these results are not highly dependent on the choice of one model layer (see figs. S11 and S12 for layer-wise results showing similar prediction outcomes across the full set of 11 ROIs; fig. S13 for indices of the top-predicting layers). Further, these results hold in parallel analyses conducted in AlexNet trained on the IPCL objective, as well as on the category-supervised objective (fig. S10). Thus, the category-selective feature tuning that naturally emerges in a contrastive model is able to well predict the rich and graded brain response structure of all category-selective regions. Fig. 4. Representational correspondence between model and brain. Encoding results for predicting univariate response profiles ( A ) and multivariate RDMs ( B ) are summarized for the eight NSD subjects (dots), for each DNN and low-level image statistic model. Plotted values reflect best-layer correlations, as defined using cross-validation (see Materials and Methods). Shaded regions show the range of subject-specific noise ceilings computed over the data from each ROI. Significance is assessed using paired t tests over subject-wise prediction levels between the AlexNet Barlow Twins model and each other candidate model. Horizontal bars reflect significant effects favoring the Barlow Twins model; Bonferroni corrected, P < 0.001. We also observe that the most predictive groups of DNN units are nearly always those with matched selectivity to the neural ROI (e.g., face-selective units predicting FFA and scene-selective units predicting PPA; figs. S11A and S12A). Critically, this alignment arises only as a consequence of the sparse positive encoding procedure\\u2014when repeating our analyses using unregularized linear regression, all domain-selective subsets are able to achieve reasonably high prediction levels (figs. S11B and S12B). Thus, sparse positive regularization is necessary to preserve a meaningful analogy between model and brain tuning directions during the encoding procedure, by preventing the arbitrary reorientation of DNN tuning directions in modeling brain data ( 101 ). Will any feature model be able to predict these brain data? We considered the category-selective units in untrained models, as well as two models of lower-level image statistics (GistPC and Gabor features; see Materials and Methods). Across the 11 ROIs, these three feature models achieved substantially lower prediction levels than the contrastive DNN unit subsets for both univariate (paired t test of within-subject differences, 31 of 33 tests significant, Bonferroni corrected P < 0.001) and multivariate comparisons (29 of 33 tests significant). These simpler models accounted for virtually no structure of the brain region RDMs. Finally, we tested whether a feature space designed specifically for face recognition might also show similar (or even better) emergent fits to face-selective brain regions. We trained an AlexNet model to perform supervised 3372-way face recognition using the VGGFace2 dataset [( 102 ); see Materials and Methods]. The later stages of this model can be understood as operationalizing a face-specialized feature space, with feature tuning optimized solely for face identity discrimination across variations in viewpoint, lighting, and expression. The trained VGGFace model achieved high accuracy at multi-way face individuation [\\u223c84% top-1 accuracy; linear support vector machine (SVM) trained on penultimate layer activations to held-out identities from the test set]. We used the sparse positive mapping procedure to fit encoding models from the full activation matrix of each layer to each subject\\u2019s face-selective voxels (FFA-1, FFA-2, and OFA). The face-recognition model features were less predictive than the face-selective subsets of the contrastive model (FFA-1: mean, r = 0.32 versus 0.58 for univariate prediction and r = 0.16 versus 0.47 for RDM prediction; the same trend held in FFA-2 and OFA: paired t test, statistically significant for all comparisons; Bonferroni corrected P < 0.0014; Fig. 4, A and B , red). This empirical result is consistent with other work comparing face-trained versus ImageNet-trained models ( 29 , 78 , 103 , 104 ). Thus, not just any rich feature space can capture the representational structure of these regions\\u2014the face-selective tuning emerging in the contrastive feature space is both distinctive from other feature models and better for matching these brain data. Overall, these results demonstrate that pre-identified unit subsets from a single DNN model can predict the response structure of 11 diverse category-selective regions, capturing both their univariate tuning over hundreds of natural images and their multivariate similarity structure over hundreds of thousands of pairwise comparisons. Visualizing the emergence of category-selective representation This set of computational and empirical results offers a unifying account of category-selective regions for faces, bodies, scenes, and words, as distinct facets of an integrated population code. Self-supervised contrastive learning over a rich image diet naturally yields rich discriminative, diet-dependent features. These features are not \\u201cabout\\u201d any one category\\u2014the learning is entirely self-supervised and does not presuppose categories. Instead, the set of all features in a layer work together to differentiate all kinds of content. By implication, that model units learn robust face, body, scene, and word selectivity implies that these categories have image statistics that are particularly distinctive in the space of natural image views. Further, this tuning arises gradually across the hierarchical stages (fig. S1), effectively routing images from their (tangled) pixel-based representation to increasingly distinctive and separable parts of the population code. To provide a graphical intuition for this progressive untangling of implicit category information, Fig. 5 traces the representational similarity of a small probe set of images from four categories, across several hierarchical processing stages of the contrastive model (conv1, conv3, conv5, and fc7; Fig. 5A ; see Materials and Methods). Each dot reflects an image, where images that are far apart in each multidimensional scaling (MDS) plot reflects the degree that they evoke more distinct activation patterns across the units in a layer. Early stages show a more \\u201ctangled\\u201d population code where images from different categories are intermixed, while later stages show clearer emergent separability of these categories. Fig. 5. Low-dimensional projection of category-selective axes in a contrastive feature space. ( A ) Image trajectories through the Barlow Twins model hierarchy are assessed using a probe image set with 30 images from each of four categories ( 105 ). Each dot reflects the embedding of a single image within a given layer. Only layers conv1, conv3, conv5, and fc7 are included (left to right); each connected sequence of dots shows the hierarchical trajectory of a single image\\u2019s feature representations through these four layers in MDS space (see Materials and Methods). ( B ) Low-dimensional schematic of category-selective regions in two-dimensional PC space of layer relu6, computed using the ImageNet validation set (see Materials and Methods). Feature representations from the same set of probe stimuli as (A) are plotted in this PC space; each image is a dot. Four additional image categories from the same localizer set are plotted: bodies (pink), phones (yellow), cars (orange), and chairs (sky blue). Tuning vectors of the top 25 most selective units for faces (red), scenes (dark blue), and objects (light blue-gray) are projected into the PC space; arrows connect the origin of the space to the projection of each selective unit. Images containing identifiable human faces are masked. Figure 5B aims to help convey how different category-selective tuning emerges within the same layer. The population code from the relu6 layer is plotted for a probe set of eight categories ( 105 ), along the first two principal components (PCs) derived from model responses to the ImageNet validation set. In this low-dimensional projection, images of faces, buildings, and bodies naturally have distinctive unit activations from each other as evidenced by their separable clustering. We then took the pre-identified face, building, and object-selective model units (from the initial localizer procedure) and projected them into the PC space, indicated by arrows. This visualization helps clarify that units with particular tuning are key for enabling images of faces, bodies, or scenes to separate from all other images in the model\\u2019s representational space. Localizing these units with a statistical contrast (e.g., faces > objects) is akin to selecting units through a decision boundary in this PC space. These are illustrated with schematic dashed lines in the visualization, highlighting how category-selective units are different facets of this single, unified population code.\",\n",
      "  \"Discussion\": \"DISCUSSION The category-selective regions of visual cortex and their relationship to each other and the surrounding occipitotemporal cortex (OTC) have been the subject of intense debate [e.g., ( 2 , 3 )]. Here, we present an updated computational-empirical account of category-selective tuning along the human ventral visual stream. We show that deep neural network models with contrastive objectives, trained over a rich image diet without any labels or category-specific pressures, naturally learn features with emergent category-selective tuning. Further, these emergent model features yield functionally dissociable deficits when lesioned, revealing that implicit modularization naturally arises from very general learning constraints. Finally, the category-selective feature tuning learned across these model units can predict the neural response structure of all corresponding category-selective regions to hundreds of natural images\\u2014e.g., predicting face-selective regions better than a model trained solely on face images. On the basis of these results, we present a unifying contrastive coding account of category selectivity in the brain, arguing that regions like FFA and PPA arise as an emergent consequence of contrastive learning over a rich natural image diet, where positive routing of information along a feature hierarchy implicitly untangles the categorical structure of visual input. A contrastive coding alternative to modular and distributed coding frameworks How are categories represented in the late stage of the ventral visual stream? Modular coding frameworks typically assume that regions tuned to faces, bodies, scenes, and words have distinct features, specialized for tasks within their specific domains, and that these tuning properties are unrelated to those of other category-selective regions and the surrounding cortex ( 32 ). At the other extreme, distributed coding frameworks typically assume that the entire large-scale cortical area is involved in coding for each category, where all regions contribute toward representing all categories through distributed patterns of activity ( 2 ). Here, drawing on our results, we present an alternative account where high-level category information is represented with a \\u201ccontrastive code.\\u201d This alternative framework makes distinctive commitments regarding (i) the nature of the feature tuning in selective regions and (ii) their functional involvement for reading out category information. First, what does the contrastive coding framework offer about the nature of the tuning in high-level visual cortex? Our account of feature tuning in these regions draws on the principles of contrastive learning objectives, where the learned features are directly determined by the set of visual inputs that must be differentiated. By implication, because the feature tuning is necessarily dependent on the learning diet, the learned selectivities also reflect the scope of the visual input, even in the absence of category supervision. Learning contrastive features from the ImageNet diet necessarily involves learning to distinguish finely among over 1 million images depicting a broad range of content. As these contrastive features become progressively more untangled over the hierarchy, they become increasingly selective for specific image distinctions. This allows us to identify units with category-selective tuning using the same category localization procedures applied in classic neuroimaging experiments. For instance, we demonstrate that face-selective units \\u201cpoint to\\u201d a specific part of this high-level, contrastive feature space where face images cluster, distinct from the feature directions selective for scenes, bodies, and words. In this way, the precise nature of these contrastive features aligns more with distributed coding theories, because the tuning of any single region fundamentally depends on the tuning across the rest of the population, which collectively works to segregate and distinguish the entire range of visual input. Second, what does the contrastive coding framework offer about how category information is read out of a contrastive feature space? Within distributed coding frameworks, the information is assumed to be spread across the entire population (like a bar code) and thus must be extracted through fully connected linear readout. In a contrastive space, however, although the features are part of a shared population code, we show that recognizing individual categories does not require fully connected readout. That is, our implementation of a sparse readout module for category recognition demonstrates that connections to only a small subset of contrastive features can support recognition of any particular category. In this way, we propose that readout from a contrastive code aligns more closely with modular theories, as further demonstrated by the selective and dissociable deficits that arise when lesioning different units. In essence, only a critical subset of units are causally linked to the functional recognition of each category, and these relationships are predictable from high activation levels. The success of sparse readout from a contrastive feature space has important theoretical implications. This result clarifies that a middle position between modular and distributed frameworks is actually possible, challenging the extreme inference that, because there cannot be a neuron for every category in the limit (the grandmother cell hypothesis), the code thus must be fully distributed and read out in a fully-connected manner. Further, from a biological plausibility perspective, sparse readout requires markedly fewer connections at the interface between a high-level visual feature bank and a cognitive categorical representation. Finally, theoretically, sparse-regularized readout offers an alternative, more constrained, measure of information evident in a population code than the current standard of linear readout [( 5 , 106 ); see ( 107 , 108 ) for review]. Implications of contrastive feature tuning and visual diet Core to our theory is the idea that the tuning of category-selective neurons in the human brain is fundamentally tied to the statistics of visual experience. We leverage models trained on the ImageNet database, which, while not aiming to be a representative sample of human visual experience, has enough scale and diversity for category selectivity for faces, bodies, scenes, and words to emerge. Yet, there are subtle differences between the models and brain data that might stem from the image diet. For instance, human OTC has extensive areas dedicated to body representation (EBA), but our model develops very few units with emergent body selectivity, possibly because the ImageNet visual diet may lack the variety in body pose and social interactions needed to capture the full spectrum of body-relevant features present in human OTC [e.g., ( 109 \\u2013 114 )]. These points of divergence are now easier to study with the introduction of datasets like EcoSet ( 115 ) and SAYCam [infant head-cam data, ( 116 )], which reflect more ecologically valid visual experiences, as well as controlled non-ecological image sets [e.g., with all faces blurred; ( 117 )]. Broadly, this contrastive coding framework lays the groundwork to implement direct manipulations of image diet variation, keeping architecture and contrastive learning objective constant, to identify which aspects of visual experience are critical to account the feature tuning found in high-level visual cortex ( 116 , 118 \\u2013 123 ). Identifying more ecologically relevant training diets may also support the discovery of previously unidentified selectivities and content distinctions within OTC, in a data-informed manner. In the current study, we test a key visual diet manipulation, comparing the feature tuning in models that receive a diverse ImageNet diet versus models that only learn to discriminate face identities. We find that the responses of face-selective brain regions to natural images are better captured by models trained on a more varied image set [see also ( 29 )]. However, here we have not directly tested whether brain response variation within face image sets is also better accounted for by the features of the ImageNet-trained model. On one hand, some evidence suggests that this will not hold. For example, in studies of DNN recognition behavior, Dobs et al. ( 124 ) have shown that models trained only for supervised object categorization (where faces are one category among others) fail at fine-grained face recognition; specific face-identity training is required to accurately classify individual identities [see also ( 125 )]. Given these computational findings and considering that face discrimination is a presumed function of FFA, it is possible that models will require face-specific learning pressures to capture between-face response variation in face-selective brain regions. On the other hand, we predict that contrastive learning over a diet encompassing both a variety of face identities and object classes should naturally learn features capable of discriminating all these inputs from one another\\u2014both differentiating faces from each other and faces from other objects\\u2014without needing additional face-specific learning pressures. This remains an open empirical question. Further suggestive evidence comes from studies measuring neural responses to diverse face stimuli in face-selective regions and comparing the predictive capacity of different DNN models. For instance, Vinken et al. examined the responses of face-selective neurons in nonhuman primates to a large set of face ( n = 447) and non-face object stimuli ( n = 932), observing that responses were better predicted by models trained on ImageNet than by those trained solely on faces ( 104 ). Chang et al. ( 126 ) observed a similar pattern when studying primate face patch responses to 2100 face images. Moreover, in analyzing groups of face-selective neurons recorded intracranially from 33 human patients, Grossman et al. ( 127 ) found that ImageNet features more closely matched brain RDMs than VGGFace features for stimulus sets containing only faces. Hence, outstanding questions persist regarding (i) whether contrastive learning can achieve individual face recognition without the need for further mechanisms and (ii) whether domain-general contrastive models can accurately fit brain responses of face-selective units when tested with stimuli designed to rigorously probe face identity information. More generally, this same caveat extends beyond face-selective areas to our broader conclusion that all category-selective regions are part of a unified contrastive feature space, whose feature tuning can be explained without the need for category-specialized pressures. Are the 515 test images from the NSD dataset used here sufficiently representative of natural images to fully support the claim? NSD images do provide a varied array of natural image content, offering the benefit of not skewing toward a particular representational hypothesis, and reflecting the most extensive probe set of these human category-selective regions to date. However, we fully recognize that more focused tests of the contrastive feature space are warranted, using new or complementary datasets containing many individual face images, body images, or visually presented word images. Model-to-brain linking with sparse positive constraints Our experiments involve two different uses of sparsity: sparse readout (for ImageNet categorization) and sparse positive linking constraints. These have different motivations. Sparse readout is focused on the internal structure of the model, dictating how one layer interacts with another. This is guided by biological considerations, such as the need for constraints on the number of \\u201cwires\\u201d or connections required for successful readout. On the other hand, sparse positive encoding constraints deal with the relationship between two systems: one artificial and one biological. In this case, the objective is to naturally align tuning curves with minimal remixing and reweighting of the input data. We next discuss the rationale for this constrained linking procedure between deep neural network units and brain measurements. Linear encoding models are the current standard approach for relating unit tuning in a deep neural network to voxel or neuron responses. That is, each voxel (or neuron)\\u2019s tuning is modeled as a positively and negatively weighted combination of all features in a DNN layer ( 103 , 128 \\u2013 131 ) or, in some cases, across multiple layers ( 132 ). Such methods reflect the popular theoretical assumption that the geometry of the feature space is the key determinant of downstream information readout. When considering only the geometry of a space, uniformly rotating all the units\\u2019 tuning directions does not affect the information that can be linearly decoded from the population. However, such rotations would certainly affect which information gets routed from one layer to the next (because only positive activations travel forward in a relu network). Thus, because standard linear encoding procedures allow for arbitrary rotations of tuning directions, they are agnostic to the functional role of tuning (i.e., selectivity) within the broader system [see ( 133 \\u2013 135 ) for review]. In contrast, our sparse positive linking method operationalizes the idea that tuning directions are critical to the function of the system, drawing upon evidence from human neuropsychology [e.g., ( 56 )], primate electrophysiology [e.g., ( 136 )], and the lesioning results presented here. How does sparse positive regularization prioritize the role of tuning directions? Sparsity (L1 penalty) promotes minimal feature remixing, as it permits only a select few features from the training set to combine and predict the tuning of each target voxel (or neuron). The fact that we restrict encoding of each category-selective region to DNN units with matched selectivity introduces an even stronger sparsity constraint, requiring a direct correspondence between the tuning of selective units in the DNN and selective voxels in the ventral stream. The positivity constraint plays a complementary role, limiting the degree to which the sparse encoding weights can rotate or \\u201cflip\\u201d DNN unit feature directions to map onto brain tuning profiles. Allowing negative encoding weights can lead to counterintuitive and undesirable outcomes, such as scene-selective units achieving high predictivity for (anticorrelated) face-selective ROIs, a phenomenon that we document in figs. S11 and S12 and in a separate manuscript ( 101 ). Together, these sparsity and positivity constraints strongly limit the complexity of the mapping function, providing a more coherent, theoretically informed approach for studying brain alignment. A unifying account of visual category selectivity We have shown that diverse category-selective signatures arise within neural networks trained on rich natural image datasets, without the need for explicit category-focused rules. Our findings help reconcile the long-standing tension between modular and distributed theories of category selectivity. Drawing on modular viewpoints, we offer that category-selective regions play a privileged role in processing certain types of visual categories over others. We show that domain-specific mechanisms are not necessary to learn these functional subdivisions. Rather, they emerge spontaneously from a domain-general contrastive objective, as the system learns to untangle the visual input. At the same time, our results provide a computational basis for the hallmark observation of distributed coding theories: that pervasive category information is decodable across high-level visual cortex. This widespread decodability is a direct consequence of contrastive learning, since the emergent tuning in one region shapes and structures the tuning in other regions. However, this does not imply that all parts of the population are causally involved in recognizing all visual entities. Distributed representation does not entail distributed functional readout. In recognizing these key distinctions, our contrastive coding framework provides a unifying account of category selectivity, offering a more parsimonious understanding of how visual object information is represented in the human brain.\"\n",

      "  \"Abstract\": \"Abstract Objectives Development of search queries for systematic reviews (SRs) is time-consuming. In this work, we capitalize on recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and a relatively large dataset of natural language descriptions of reviews and corresponding Boolean searches to generate Boolean search queries from SR titles and key questions. Materials and Methods We curated a training dataset of 10 346 SR search queries registered in PROSPERO. We used this dataset to fine-tune a set of models to generate search queries based on Mistral-Instruct-7b. We evaluated the models quantitatively using an evaluation dataset of 57 SRs and qualitatively through semi-structured interviews with 8 experienced medical librarians. Results The model-generated search queries had median sensitivity of 85% (interquartile range [IQR] 40%-100%) and number needed to read of 1206 citations (IQR 205-5810). The interviews suggested that the models lack both the necessary sensitivity and precision to be used without scrutiny but could be useful for topic scoping or as initial queries to be refined. Discussion Future research should focus on improving the dataset with more high-quality search queries, assessing whether fine-tuning the model on other fields, such as the population and intervention, improves performance, and exploring the addition of interactivity to the interface. Conclusions The datasets developed for this project can be used to train and evaluate LLMs that map review descriptions to Boolean search queries. The models cannot replace thoughtful search query design but may be useful in providing suggestions for key words and the framework for the query.\",\n",

      "  \"Methods\": \"Materials and methods We assembled 2 datasets of systematic review topics and search queries: 1 for training, representing 10 346 reviews, and 1 for evaluation, representing 57 reviews. From the training set, we separated out 99 of the reviews, which we assessed as of relatively high quality, to use as a validation dataset. We then fine-tuned models on the (reduced) training dataset and, after selecting hyperparameters settings using the validation dataset, evaluated them using the evaluation dataset. Finally, we interviewed 8 medical librarians using semi-structured interviews to establish how to improve the models. Full details of dataset cleaning and evaluation, model training, and qualitative evaluation are given in the supplementary material . We assembled the training dataset from PROSPERO, an international prospective register of systematic review protocols maintained by the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination at the University of York and funded by the UK National Institute for Health Research. 19 , 20 The PROSPERO team shared the data for the 139 450 records with data in the \\u201csearch\\u201d field, from inception to December 24, 2021. Much of the compilation and annotation of this dataset was done manually. Briefly, we created a cleaned search query by removing methodological filters, translating the query to PubMed syntax if necessary, and fixing any obvious errors. We created 2 separate versions of the dataset: in one, the field tags (such as medical subject heading [MeSH] tags) were standardized; in the other, we removed all field tags, quotation marks, backslashes, and commas. PubMed\\u2019s interface automatically matches untagged words to their phrase index and to MeSH terms; thus, it is unlikely that this change would reduce the sensitivity of model-generated queries. However, using untagged words impacts precision, increasing the number of citations that need to be read (NNR) to find one relevant study. We needed a reasonable number of relatively high-quality queries to use as a validation set for model development and hyperparameter experiments. Thus, we created a subset of 99 search queries, including a random selection of 10 queries from PDFs (which tended to be high-quality queries) and 89 of the better queries from those entered directly in the text field. The flow of the cleaning process to date is shown in Figure 1 . Figure 2 (top row) shows the structure of the cleaned training/validation data. Figure 1. Flow diagram for PROSPERO queries to date. Each box represents a stage in the data cleaning process. From 139 450 records, 44 989 had usable information in the search fields. Of those, 10 346 have been cleaned. This figure shows the flow through cleaning. Initially, we had 139 450 records from PROSPERO. Of these, 94 461 did not report a usable search and were removed. The remaining records included 35 891 text queries in the search box. As of publication 9782 of these had been manually cleaned. There were also 9098 queries in pdf documents. As of publication, 564 of these had been cleaned. The final dataset includes 10 346 cleaned records. Figure 2. Data. The top row shows the structure of the data used to train/validate the models. It includes the title and key question in free text along with a manually curated PubMed search query. The middle row shows the structure of the data used to evaluate the models. It shows the title source (Wang/Adam), the free-text title, the query used in the original review (GS_query), the PMIDs of the included studies, and the 2 model-generated queries, using title only and using title + key questions). The bottom row shows the structure of the data used to replicate Wang et al\\u2019s GPT analysis. It shows the free-text title and key questions, the query used in the original review (query), the PMIDs of the included studies, and the model-generated queries, for each prompt. Alt text: This figure shows the structure of the spreadsheet files for the data used in the project. The top panel shows the training data, containing the following headings: RecordID, Review_title, Review_question, pubmed, and CRDAccessionNumber. The middle panel shows the evaluation data, containing the following headings: no, id, source, title, GS_query, included_studies, query_title, altquery_tikq. The bottom panel shows the data for the replication of the Wang et al. GPT analysis, containing the following headings: id, title, description_question, query, wang_q1, wang_q2, wang_q3, wang_q4, this_work1, this_work2 The training queries are highly skewed with respect to the number of words they contain (median 49; IQR 30-86; range 1-2755), with fewer than 1% containing more than 400 words. This pattern also holds for the number of Boolean operators, which is a proxy for the number of concepts in each search (median 8, IQR 5-8, range 1-276). The total number of records identified by each query is also highly skewed , with 75% of queries returning fewer than 7000 citations; 597 queries return no records, which suggests that they contain a fatal error. To get a better sense of how much the removal of filters is increasing the size of the returned citation set, as an example, we crossed all searches with the PubMed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) filter. The median number of RCTs retrieved is 57 (IQR 7-368, range 0-609 069). To develop the evaluation dataset we combined 2 separate subsets: the first contained 38 of the 40 citations in Wang\\u2019s seed citation dataset 17 (which we will refer to as the \\u201cWang dataset\\u201d) used in Wang et al\\u2019s investigation of whether ChatGPT \\u00ae could be used to formulate Boolean search queries. 13 This dataset includes the titles, PubMed formatted search queries, and final included studies for 40 Cochrane systematic reviews on a variety of topics. We removed 2 records from this set that retrieved either only one or no citations in PubMed. To this, we added a second set of 19 reviews known to us (the \\u201cAdam dataset\\u201d), 18 of which were designed for systematic reviews conducted in the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality\\u2019s (AHRQ) Evidence-based Practice Center (EPC) program 21\\u201337 or in the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). 38 These searches were all peer reviewed by another systematic review librarian using the Peer Review Electronic Search Strategies (PRESS) checklist. 39 The final record in this set was for a Cochrane review that we were aware of; it is unclear whether this was peer reviewed. 40 We did not systematically search for additional reviews. For comparison with model-generated queries, we removed the tags, quotes, and commas from the data. Thus, precision/NNR results are for comparison only and do not represent the actual workload of screening. The 57 reviews in the evaluation set (38 in the Wang dataset and 19 in the Adam dataset) addressed a wide variety of biomedical topics, with query syntax ranging from simple to complex. The number of studies that were included in the systematic reviews ranged from 4 to 612, with a median of 30. The median sensitivity of the human generated searches was 100% (IQR 88%-100%), with a median NNR of 580 (IQR 161-1466); the median NNR with field tags and punctuation in the original data was 125 (IQR 57-456). We initially fine-tuned models on both the tagged and stripped datasets, but the dataset stripped of tags performed significantly better in preliminary experiments based on manual evaluation of a subset of the produced strategies in comparison with the initial strategies. Therefore, we proceeded using only this version of the training data. We marked each piece of the training data as belonging to the middle 50% (the middle quartiles) and retained only the data in both middle quartiles, leaving 4324 instances for training. We explored fine-tuning a number of models, including variants of Flan-T5 41 and BioBART, 42 but we found the best performance within our computing resources with a Mistral-Instruct 7 billion parameter chat/instruct LLM. 43 All fine-tuning experiments were conducted within the Huggingface library (v4.37.1). 44 We used the following instruction to the LLM, which we added to all training samples (ie, each review): \\u201c Translate the following into a Boolean search query to find relevant studies in PubMed. Do not add any explanation. Do not repeat terms. Prefer shorter queries .\\u201d In separate training rounds, instruction was followed by either the review\\u2019s title or its title and objectives/key questions. Due to model size and resource limitations, we fine-tuned this model using Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning 45 specifically with Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) methods. 46 During fine-tuning, we used the adafactor optimizer 47 and ran and evaluated a grid search across learning rates (1e\\u22124, 1e\\u22125, 1e\\u22126) and LoRA parameters (rank factor r : 16, 32, 64, 128, 256; scaling factor alpha: 16, r ). For each hyperparameter combination, we trained for 10 epochs with a batch size of one (owing to computational constraints), using floating point 16 precision. We used PubMed query results from the validation set to select the best model (for the \\u201ctitle-only\\u201d model), choosing the model with the highest sensitivity between the validation set reference query and the model-generated query (0.54). For the \\u201ctitle and key questions\\u201d model, we used the hyperparameters established in the best title-only model. The final models were empirically tested on the evaluation data set. Two search queries were generated for each review in this set, one for each model (title-only and title plus key questions). Figure 2 , middle row, shows the structure of the data with the generated queries. These queries were run in PubMed and compared with the reference PMIDs (those included in the corresponding systematic review\\u2019s final report) to calculate sensitivity (or recall; the number of included citations correctly identified), precision, and NNR (the number of citations that must be read to identify one relevant citation). Figure 3 illustrates the evaluation process. Figure 3. Evaluation flow diagram. Each box represents a stage in the evaluation process. The m subscript indicates that the number belongs to a specific query. Abbreviations: N = total number; PMID = PubMed identifier; NNR = number needed to read. This figure illustrates the empirical evaluation process. First, the model generated the query, then the model-generated queries, the original query, and the list of final included PMIDs were searched in PubMed through the API interface and the number of citations was retrieved. Next, the model and original queries were crossed with the final list of PMIDs and run in PubMed to get the number of true positives. Finally, the following statistics were calculated: sensitivity, precision, and number needed to read. Further analyses explored whether model performance differed by evaluation review source (Wang or Adam). The search description in the Wang dataset comprises only a few words, while the key questions in the Adam dataset comprise a full description of the questions the review seeks to answer. We also evaluated whether any queries had syntactical errors that lead to errors in PubMed. Finally, we evaluated whether any queries \\u201cfailed,\\u201d defined as retrieving none of the review\\u2019s final included PMIDs. Exceedingly high retrieval could also be considered failing. However, in this case, the design of the study led to artificially high NNR, so that was not considered as a failure of the query. Finally, we re-ran Wang et al\\u2019s 13 analysis for the first 4 of their original prompts, using GPT-4 to see if the performance had improved. Figure 2 , bottom row, shows the structure of the data with the generated queries. Full details of this analysis are in the Supplementary Material . The models were also qualitatively evaluated through a set of virtual semi-structured interviews with experienced medical librarians who tested the models through a web-based interface, 48 hereafter referred to as the query tool. A single researcher (G.P.A.) conducted separate interviews with 8 medical librarians: 4 systematic review librarians affiliated with AHRQ-funded EPCs, 3 university-affiliated academic librarians, and 1 hospital-affiliated librarian. The librarians were asked to share their screens and try out the query tool on a topic for which they had a previously developed a search query. The tool generated 2 queries, one for each model, and the librarians were asked to evaluate one or both generated queries in the PubMed interface and compare them with their manually developed query. As they were doing so, the interviewer encouraged each participant to reflect on their experiences and asked a series of questions in a semi-structured interview format, guided by a topic guide based on the 2015 PRESS Checklist Reviewer Form 39 for search strategy peer review. In analysis, we used a modified version of the framework analysis described by Gale et al. 49 To ensure participant anonymity, each librarian was assigned a participant number. The interviewer transcribed all interviews verbatim using the Zoom \\u00ae automatic transcription tool. Using the qualitative analysis software NVivo (version 1.7.1), the interviewer coded each cleaned transcript, associating each block of text to a set of descriptive or conceptual labels, thus classifying the data and allowing for the collocation of the pieces of text across multiple interviews that addressed the same concepts. Finally, all codes were pulled together, and each was summarized in a few words. This allowed the interviewer to identify a set of 5 themes.\",\n",
      "  \"Results\": \"Results The empirical performance of the queries generated by the title-only and title plus key questions models were similar but varied widely across the reviews in the evaluation set. For 3 reviews, at least one model \\u201cfailed,\\u201d in that it identified none of the relevant citations, while for 20 of the 57 reviews at least one model identified all the relevant citations. Figure 4 shows the sensitivity, NNR, and word count for the queries generated by each model and the human query for each review. Figure 4. Performance of models on each review. Each bar represents 1 of the 57 evaluation reviews. The darker lines represent the Wang reviews and the lighter lines represent the Adam reviews. The top row shows sensitivity across search query source, the middle row NNR, and the bottom row word count. Abbreviations: KQ = key question; NNR = number needed to read. This figure shows 9 bar charts, with a single bar for each evaluation review. The first three show the sensitivity for the Title-only, Title + KQ, and Human-generated queries. The results show overall high sensitivity, but with some reviews having poor performance. The second three show the NNR for the Title-only, Title + KQ, and Human-generated queries. The results show wide variation in NNR across reviews. The last three show the word counts for the Title-only, Title + KQ, and Human-generated queries. The results show similar and relatively low word counts for the model-generated queries, and much higher and more varying word counts for the human-generated queries. No query had a syntactical error that kept it from running in PubMed or retrieved 0 records. This is not surprising; with the MeSH tags, quotes, commas, and so on stripped, there are few places for the model to introduce syntactical errors, except in the Boolean operators and parentheses. NNRs varied widely, with 7 queries in the title only, 3 in the title and key question model, and 2 in the human having NNR over 2000. All model-generated queries contained fewer words than the human queries. This is likely the result of the instruction provided to the model to prefer shorter queries and training data selection. Table 1 shows the summarized results for each model on the evaluation set, both in total and for each of the 2 evaluation datasets. The model-generated queries performed better on the Adam dataset (which was largely derived from systematic reviews for the AHRQ EPC program) than on the Wang dataset (which was mostly based on Cochrane reviews). In general, topics in EPC reviews tend to be broader and more complex than those in Cochrane reviews. However, it may be that the Wang topics were more challenging, given that the sensitivity of the human generated queries for this dataset was also lower. The precision of the human-generated queries was also worse for the Wang data, although the precision of the model-generated queries in the Wang data was slightly better. Table 1.

The search topics were all health-related but varied widely, including reproductive health, violence, cancer, mental health, pain management, acupuncture, child development, irritable bowel syndrome, cognitive functioning, and medical cannabis. Because the sample of each librarian type was small (1 to 4 librarians), it was not possible to attribute themes to specific librarian types. Thus, the 5 themes shown in Table 3 and described in detail in the Supplementary Material reflect the full set of 8 librarians. Table 3. Themes as derived from the coded text. Theme Definition Example quotations Theme 1: Sensitivity Is the tool-developed query finding the relevant studies? \\u201c I can\\u2019t say ... that I found a single real article in [the missed citations] that focused on glioblastoma [the search topic].

Then would there be another section where it put them all together so that someone could copy and paste it into PubMed. \\u201d [Participant 6] 5c. \\u201c If there is a way to have it [have] almost a brief interactive reference interview of sorts ... and then is able to pull the key concepts out of that \\u201d [Participant 6] Abbreviations: MeSH = medical subject headings; PICO = population, intervention, comparator, outcome; PRESS = peer review of electronic search strategies. There were 3 takeaways from the 5 themes: First, the queries developed are sensitive enough to be a good starting place in the search development process for systematic reviews. In general, the queries correctly identified the relevant concepts and produced initial keywords. The comparably large number of citations they return is problematic but may be ameliorated by re-introducing quotation marks, standard vocabulary (MeSH terms), field terms, and filters. Three of the librarians tested this and found that the numbers were reduced, but we did not assess it formally. Additionally, ranking algorithms, such as PubMed\\u2019s Best Match algorithm, 50 may be useful in prioritizing relevant results. Second, the tool-generated queries are not an end point in and of themselves. They lack both the necessary sensitivity and precision to be used without scrutiny. Each librarian stated that it would be very important to educate users, particularly non-librarian users, about this limitation. It is, however, possible that it could be used as a teaching tool or as a starting place for non-expert searchers. Finally, the librarians made useful suggestions for further development of this technology. These included: training the models on better data, allowing for modular search by concept (for example, population and interventions), adding interactivity to better mimic the reference interview, in which librarians elicit details about the information need, and algorithmic post-processing to assist in the process of re-applying quotation marks, standard vocabulary (MeSH terms), field terms, and filters.\",\n",
      "  \"Discussion\": \"Discussion The datasets we have compiled should be useful for exploring and testing automation methods for query generation, and perhaps other aspects of search design. To our knowledge, the PROSPERO dataset we generated is the largest dataset of systematic review metadata (titles, objectives, and PICO elements) and corresponding properly formatted search queries. The evaluation data includes basic metadata (title and search description or key questions), the original search query in PubMed format, and the finally included citations for a wide variety of reviews. The model-generated queries yielded moderate sensitivity but are not ready for unaudited use in searches where the goal is to include all eligible studies. In addition, the NNR was too high for regular use, although the re-introduction of field tags, quotations, and validated filters would reduce the screening burden substantially. Moreover, implementation of machine learning abstract screening tools has been shown to reduce the number of abstracts that must be screened by humans by as much as 50% with minimal loss of relevant records. 51 These methods could be combined with automatic query generation to reduce the impact of the higher numbers of records identified during searches. Limitations The search strategies in the PROSPERO dataset are likely to be a good representation of final publishable search strategies. But they are imperfect because they were often the initial search for the review published in the protocol rather than the final peer-reviewed query. In addition, they may not always perfectly represent the original query posted in PROSPERO as many were manually or automatically altered in the cleaning process. Finally, we cleaned the queries with pasted search terms first, likely enriching the training dataset with shorter and more generic queries. Models trained on final searches or on the Population and Intervention/Exposure fields may perform better. We chose to train and test the model on only the review title field and the objectives or key questions field for 3 reasons. First, not everyone is able to break a topic or set of questions down into its component parts, so it is beneficial for a model to be able to automatically parse a topic. Also, not every review follows the standard PICO format (eg, reviews of disease prevalence or research methods). Second, and related, the more the model requires the user to break down the topic and propose PICO terms, the less it actually helps in the process. Third, unlike the title and key questions, these fields vary widely in their content and structure and so may not be sufficiently consistent for fine-tuning. We evaluated only a single, representative open-source LLM (Mistral-Instruct 7b). Our aim was to establish feasibility of generating search queries automatically via LLMs, rather than to establish which among the now-many LLMs performs \\u201cbest\\u201d at this task. Larger models would likely yield better results, but we did not have the computational resources to fine-tune them. Proprietary models, like ChatGPT, may also be used to aid search design, but these cannot be fine-tuned. Moreover, we are interested in designing and sharing usable, open-source LLMs that can be used as search aids. At the time these experiments began, Mistral-Instruct-7B was outperforming other models by a wide margin. Likewise, we did not perform any extensive prompt engineering experiments. We believe the GPT-4 experiments demonstrate that relatively simple prompting strategies are not likely to succeed, which is why focused on fine-tuning. Additional prompt tuning might be a valuable future research direction. The qualitative analysis was exploratory and therefore relied on librarians with whom the lead researcher was familiar. The results may, therefore, not be representative of librarians in different settings or countries or with different foci. However, the librarians were experts in the field with many years of experience, which made them uniquely able to provide thoughtful and informed input that is helpful in determining next steps in the effort to leverage AI in the identification of studies for evidence synthesis. Because of the small sample of librarians, we did not explore the ways that different settings (research, academic, and hospital) affected the librarian\\u2019s reaction to the query tool, which would be of interest. Finally, due to time and resource constraints, only a single researcher (G.P.A.) conducted interviews and analyzed the qualitative data, potentially introducing flaws and bias.\"\n",

      "  \"Abstract\": \"Non-ionic deep eutectic solvents (DESs) are non-ionic designer solvents with various applications in catalysis, extraction, carbon capture, and pharmaceuticals. However, discovering new DES candidates is challenging due to a lack of efficient tools that accurately predict DES formation. The search for DES relies heavily on intuition or trial-and-error processes, leading to low success rates or missed opportunities. Recognizing that hydrogen bonds (HBs) play a central role in DES formation, we aim to identify HB features that distinguish DES from non-DES systems and use them to develop machine learning (ML) models to discover new DES systems. We first analyze the HB properties of 38 known DES and 111 known non-DES systems using their molecular dynamics (MD) simulation trajectories. The analysis reveals that DES systems have two unique features compared to non-DES systems: The DESs have 1 more imbalance between the numbers of the two intra-component HBs and 2 more and stronger inter-component HBs. Based on these results, we develop 30 ML models using ten algorithms and three types of HB-based descriptors. The model performance is first benchmarked using the average and minimal receiver operating characteristic (ROC)-area under the curve (AUC) values. We also analyze the importance of individual features in the models, and the results are consistent with the simulation-based statistical analysis. Finally, we validate the models using the experimental data of 34 systems. The extra trees forest model outperforms the other models in the validation, with an ROC-AUC of 0.88. Our work illustrates the importance of HBs in DES formation and shows the potential of ML in discovering new DESs.\",\n",
      "  \"Introduction\": \"1. Introduction Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) are liquid mixtures composed of hydrogen bond acceptors (HBAs) and donors (HBDs) that exhibit tunable properties [ 1 \\u2013 13 ]. DESs have gained attention as sustainable solvents in a number of applications, including carbon capture [ 2 , 14 \\u2013 16 ], pharmaceuticals [ 9 , 14 , 15 , 17 \\u2013 23 ], material synthesis [ 8 , 19 , 24 ], electrochemistry [ 9 , 14 , 25 \\u2013 37 ], decontamination [ 17 , 18 ], and extractions [ 6 , 8 , 24 , 38 \\u2013 41 ], due to their potential for recovery [ 42 ] and reuse [ 43 ]. Non-ionic DESs have several desirable properties\\u2014including biodegradability, high conductivity, low volatility, and low toxicity\\u2014as compared with conventional solvents [ 2 , 8 , 38 , 43 , 44 ]. Popularly classified as type V DESs [ 4 , 14 \\u2013 16 , 38 ], non-ionic DES can be made using natural compounds and exhibit low viscosity, making them particularly suitable for industrial applications such as liquid\\u2013liquid extraction and carbon nanomaterial production [ 12 , 38 , 45 ]. One of the main challenges in the field of DES is the discovery of a large collection of DES candidates, which would enable the community to have a vast pool to explore and to search for the ones with the desired properties. Numerous experimental and computational studies have shown the important role of hydrogen bonds (HBs) in the formation and properties of DESs [ 1 , 2 , 4 , 9 , 14 , 15 , 39 , 42 , 46 ]. Farias et al. [ 43 ] carried out an experimental study to understand the role of the HBDs of DESs in aqueous biphasic systems. They concluded that HBDs with high relative hydrophilicity mainly serve as adjuvants in biphasic systems, while HBDs with moderate hydrophilicity control the formation of biphasic systems, and HBDs with low hydrophilicity (high hydrophobicity) form aqueous biphasic systems, with the HBAs acting as adjuvants in such systems. Abranches et al. [ 1 ] investigated the suitability of betaine, a molecule with polarity imbalance, as a universal HBA in the formation of DESs. Their study used a combination of experiments and density functional theory calculations and concluded that betaine is a suitable choice for producing natural DESs due to its non-selective nature, low cost, and low toxicity. These fundamental studies highlight the important role of HBs in DES formation and properties, indicating that HB-based descriptors could serve as suitable inputs to discover new DESs. Machine learning (ML) models are becoming increasingly popular for predicting the physicochemical and thermophysical properties of DESs [ 17 , 19 , 46 \\u2013 51 ]. A review by Hansen et al. [ 15 ] summarized studies that developed quantitative structure\\u2013property relationship models for predicting DES properties [ 6 , 15 ]. Halder et al. [ 51 ] used a cheminformatics approach to determine the structural attributes of DESs necessary for accurate predictions of densities in industrial applications. They utilized a consensus modeling approach and concluded that features such as the number of HBDs, lipophilicity, polarizability, and van der Waals surface area could be used to obtain highly accurate estimates of novel DES densities. Dietz et al. [ 6 ] used perturbed-chain statistical association fluid theory (PC-SAFT) modeling to predict the liquid\\u2013liquid equilibrium and solid\\u2013liquid equilibrium of mixtures of hydrophobic DES with water or hydroxymethyl furfural, demonstrating the efficacy of this approach for predicting the phase behavior of hydrophobic DES mixtures. Other studies have employed ML algorithms to estimate the densities and viscosities of DESs. Abdollahzadeh et al. [ 19 ] compared seven ML algorithms and showed that least squares support vector regression had the highest accuracy in predicting the densities of 149 DESs, performing 74.5% better than the best results obtained via empirical correlations. Zamora et al. [ 16 ] compared the suitability of five ML algorithms, trained on experimental data, to predict the densities and viscosities of type V DESs. Their study concluded that support vector machines performed best at predicting densities, and Gaussian process regression models did best at predicting viscosities. Xu et al. [ 50 ] used gradient boosting models to predict DES viscosities; their model showed satisfactory results when trained and tested on experimental and simulation data. Overall, these studies demonstrate the potential of combining ML and molecular simulations to predict the properties of DESs. In contrast to other studies that focus on predicting the properties of DESs, our work aims to use ML models to predict the formation of DES systems. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation has emerged as a valuable technique for determining descriptors to be used as inputs for ML models [ 14 , 24 , 46 ]. We hypothesize that HB properties could serve as predictors for the formation of DESs. However, determining the relevant HB properties is not trivial. Our previous work [ 52 ] classified non-ionic DESs into three groups based on the ratio of intra- and inter-component HB numbers. These observations inspired us to explore the possibility of developing ML models using HB-based descriptors. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to use ML models to classify solvents as DES or non-DES. In ML model training, data is a crucial element. To facilitate our research, we curated a library of 38 known DES and 111 non-DES systems from the literature. The construction of this library allows us to conduct statistical analysis on molecular simulation data, which can be used to develop training and testing datasets for model development. We curated a separate library of 34 systems to validate our model performance. Given the size of our database, this paper focuses on traditional ML algorithms. We utilized ten ML algorithms; however, we acknowledge that deep learning algorithms have emerged as a promising technique for designing materials. One obstacle to using deep learning algorithms for predicting the formation of DESs is the relative sparsity of experimentally verified DESs in the literature. Models such as the one we developed could help speed up the discovery of novel DESs by generating solvent mixtures likely to form DESs. The rest of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides details on the computational methods, Section 3 presents the results and discussion, and Section 4 gives our conclusions.\",\n",

      "  \"Results\": \"3.3. Model validation with experimental results We validated the 30 trained models using 34 experimental results (17 DES and 17 non-DES systems). The results are presented in Table 3 . For models trained with the HB lifetime features, the XGBoost-random forest, logistic regression, and extra trees forest were the top performers, with ROC-AUC values of 0.68, 0.65, and 0.65, respectively, during validation. Support vector machine, extra trees forest, and gradient boost were the top performers, with ROC-AUC values of 0.80, 0.79, and 0.77, respectively, when the models were trained with the HB number features. Extra trees forest, logistic regression, and gradient boost were the top-performing models, with ROC-AUC values of 0.88, 0.84, and 0.81, respectively, among the models trained with both HB number and lifetime. In general, the ensemble algorithms (bagging and boosting) were observed to perform well. Bagging algorithms such as random forest, extra trees forest, and decision tree build and train independent estimators, and then average the independent predictions of these estimators to make a final prediction. This can help reduce variance in predictions and increase accuracy. The boosting algorithms (XGBoost, XGBoost-random forest, AdaBoost, and gradient boost), on the other hand, train several estimators sequentially. Each estimator focuses on reducing the errors of the previous estimator, and this typically reduces bias. Fig. 6 presents confusion matrices for the top-performing models under each of the three input feature categories during validation. The confusion matrices present true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives for each model\\u2019s predictions. In this study, DESs are positives, while non-DESs are negatives. The sensitivity measures how many DESs were correctly predicted to be DESs, while the specificity measures how many non-DESs were correctly predicted to be non-DESs by a model. Some models were better at predicting DESs (high sensitivity), while some were better at predicting non-DESs (high specificity). XGBoost-random forest was the top-performing algorithm among the models trained with HB lifetime features. It performed best at predicting which systems were DESs, as shown by its high sensitivity of 0.82 ( Fig. 6(a) ), but it was not good at predicting which systems were non-DESs (with a low specificity of 0.47, Fig. 6(a) ). Among the models trained with HB number features, the support vector machine was the top-performing algorithm. It had a specificity of 0.88 ( Fig. 6(c) ), which means that it performed best at predicting which systems were non-DESs. Its low sensitivity of 0.35 ( Fig. 6(c) ) means that it was not good at predicting DESs. When models were trained with combined HB lifetime and number features as inputs, the extra trees forest model performed best. It had a sensitivity of 0.76 ( Fig. 6(e) ), indicating it was among the top performers at predicting which systems were DESs. It had a specificity of 0.94 ( Fig. 6(e) ), indicating it was the top performer at predicting which systems were non-DESs. Relative to the top-performing models in other input feature categories, the extra trees forest algorithm was the best overall at predicting DESs and non-DESs. The confusion matrices for all models are shown in Figs. S18 \\u2013 S20 in Appendix A .\",\n",
