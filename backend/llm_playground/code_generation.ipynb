Thus, It solves the problem of information overload upto a remarkable extent. Specifically, It is highly applicable in certain industries that sell the productonlineorprovidetheservicesonline.RecommendationSystemsareveryrelevantinsuchadomainbecausetheycangrowtheir business by putting it in the practice. In this review article, we offer an overview of the Recommendation Systems and their variations and extension. We address the numerous techniques used for Recommendation Systems, including content-based filtering, collaborative filtering, sequential, session-based, etc. A comparison has been given for each technique for detailed analysis. It extends the review for the variety of dataset domains, such as movies, music, jobs, products, books, etc. Besides datasets, We have discussed various applications of the recommendation Systems across multiple domains in the industry. We survey various evaluation metrics used in a wide range of Recommendation Systems. In the end, we summarized the different challenges posed by the recommendation Systems, which helps make them more accurate and reliable.

When predicting Session-based recommendation systems have a wide range the next item, SRSs use the user’s long-term preferences as of applications, including Music Recommendations, Rental well as previous recommendations [16]. This requires that Recommendations, Product Recommendations, and so on, the SRS’s input data be either chronologically organized according to [79]. or contain time-stamps, so that this organization may be considered when making recommendations [69] [70]. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have been utilized in various studies to make session-based recommendations.

The evaluation metric that is to be considered for comparison is Mean Absolute Error(MAE). Lower the MAE values, the higher the model’s accuracy.
